Because the name <i>Gaius</i> was very common in the Roman Empire, it is highly unlikely that the person named here is to be identified with any of the others of the same name associated with Paul (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"1Cor.1.14\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor.1.14&amp;version=NET\">1 Cor 1:14</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Rom.16.23\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom.16.23&amp;version=NET\">Rom 16:23</a> [these two references are probably to the same person]; <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Acts.19.29\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts.19.29&amp;version=NET\">Acts 19:29</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Acts.20.4\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts.20.4&amp;version=NET\">Acts 20:4</a>). A 4th century tradition recorded in the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> 7.46.9 (ca. <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 370) states that John the Apostle ordained Gaius as bishop of Pergamum, but this is questionable because of the relatively late date. The only certain information about this individual must be obtained from 3 John itself, and there is not a great deal there. It is obvious that this person is well known to the author, but it is not so certain whether they had met personally or not, because the report of Gaius\u2019 conduct toward the brothers is received secondhand by the author (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"3John.1.3\" href=\"/passage/?search=3John.1.3&amp;version=NET\">v. 3</a>). Nor can it be determined with certainty whether Gaius belonged to the same local church as Diotrephes (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"3John.1.9\" href=\"/passage/?search=3John.1.9&amp;version=NET\">v. 9</a>), or was himself the leader of another local congregation. It is clear that the author regarded him as orthodox (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"3John.1.3\" href=\"/passage/?search=3John.1.3&amp;version=NET\">v. 3</a>) and a valuable ally in the controversy with the secessionist opponents and their false Christology discussed at length in 1 John.</span></li>\n<li id=\"fen-NET-30644d\"><a href=\"#en-NET-30644\" title=\"Go to 3 John 1:1\">3 John 1:1</a> <span class=\"footnote-text\"><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <span xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u1fb3</span> (<i>en al\u0113theia</i>) in <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"3John.1.1\" href=\"/passage/?search=3John.1.1&amp;version=NET\">3 John 1</a> is similar to <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"2John.1.1\" href=\"/passage/?search=2John.1.1&amp;version=NET\">2 John 1</a>, although it is not qualified here as it is there (see <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"2John.1.1\" href=\"/passage/?search=2John.1.1&amp;version=NET\">2 John 1</a>). This is not merely the equivalent of an adverb (\u201ctruly\u201d), but is a theological statement affirming the orthodoxy of Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed. \u201cTruth\u201d is the author\u2019s way of alluding to theological orthodoxy in the face of the challenge by the opponents (see <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"1John.3.19\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John.3.19&amp;version=NET\">1 John 3:19</a>).</span></li>\n<li id=\"fen-NET-30645e\"><a href=\"#en-NET-30645\" title=\"Go to 3 John 1:2\">3 John 1:2</a> <span class=\"footnote-text\"><b>tn</b> The noun <span xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae</span> (<i>psuch\u0113</i>) is used 10 times in the Gospel of John and 2 times in 1 John; of these 6 of the uses in John and both in 1 John refer to a person\u2019s \u201clife\u201d (as something that can be laid down). In <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"John.10.24\" href=\"/passage/?search=John.10.24&amp;version=NET\">John 10:24</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"John.12.27\" href=\"/passage/?search=John.12.27&amp;version=NET\">12:27</a> the <span xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae</span> is that part of a person where emotions are experienced; one\u2019s <span xml:lang=\"grc\">\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae</span> is held in suspense or deeply troubled. This is, in other words, the immaterial part of a person as opposed to his physical existence.

The equivalent contemporary idiom would be to speak of \u201cspiritual\u201d health as opposed to physical health. The author affirms that Gaius is indeed well off spiritually, and he prays that Gaius\u2019 physical health would match his spiritual health, i.e., that Gaius would be as well off physically as he is spiritually. It is the spiritual health which is to be the standard by which one\u2019s physical health is measured, not the other way round.</span></li>\n<li id=\"fen-NET-30646f\"><a href=\"#en-NET-30646\" title=\"Go to 3 John 1:3\">3 John 1:3</a> <span class=\"footnote-text\"><b>sn</b> <i>Living according to the truth</i> (<i>Grk</i> \u201cwalking in [the] truth\u201d).

In Rabbinic literature \u201cthe Name\u201d is a frequent substitute for the Tetragrammaton YHWH, the name of God, which was too sacred to be pronounced. This would make good logical sense in 3 John, because in the previous verse the author has instructed Gaius to send the missionaries on their way \u201cin a manner worthy of God.\u201d (2) Some have understood \u201cthe Name\u201d as the self-designation of the Johannine community, or as a reference to the Christian cause at large, or as a way of designating Christians before the title \u201cChristian\u201d came into common usage. (3) The interpretation favored by most commentators is that this is a reference to Jesus\u2019 name. Paul uses a similar phrase in <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Rom.1.5\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom.1.5&amp;version=NET\">Rom 1:5</a>, and in <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"1John.2.12\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John.2.12&amp;version=NET\">1 John 2:12</a> the author wrote, \u201cyour sins are forgiven on account of His (Christ\u2019s) name.\u201d John\u2019s Gospel also makes reference to believing \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"John.1.12\" href=\"/passage/?search=John.1.12&amp;version=NET\">John 1:12</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"John.3.18\" href=\"/passage/?search=John.3.18&amp;version=NET\">3:18</a>).</span></li>\n<li id=\"fen-NET-30650p\"><a href=\"#en-NET-30650\" title=\"Go to 3 John 1:7\">3 John 1:7</a> <span class=\"footnote-text\"><b>tn</b> The word <span xml:lang=\"grc\">\u1f10\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2</span> (<i>ethnikos</i>) occurs only 4 times in the NT (the other three are in <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Matt.5.47\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt.5.47&amp;version=NET\">Matt 5:47</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Matt.6.7\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt.6.7&amp;version=NET\">6:7</a>; and <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"Matt.18.17\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt.18.17&amp;version=NET\">18:17</a>).

There is precedent in the Johannine literature for understanding \u201ctruth\u201d as personified (<a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"John.8.32\" href=\"/passage/?search=John.8.32&amp;version=NET\">John 8:32</a>, \u201cthe truth will make you free\u201d; possibly also <a class=\"bibleref\" data-bibleref=\"1John.3.19\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John.3.19&amp;version=NET\">1 John 3:19</a>).

Thus it seems likely that the \u201ctruth\u201d at work through the missionaries here is ultimately the Holy Spirit, who works through their efforts.
