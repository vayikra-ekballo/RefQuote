</DL><B>1 Timothy 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_1">1</a>]</sup>   he desires a noble task.<DT>2 <DD>Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,<DT>3 <DD>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.<DT>4 <DD>He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.<DT>5 <DD>(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)<DT>6 <DD>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.<DT>7 <DD>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.<DT>8 <DD>Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.<DT>9 <DD>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.<DT>10 <DD>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.<DT>11 <DD>In the same way, their wives <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_2">2</a>]</sup>   are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.<DT>12 <DD>A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.<DT>13 <DD>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.<DT>14 <DD>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,<DT>15 <DD>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.<DT>16 <DD>Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_3">3</a>]</sup>   appeared in a body, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_4">4</a>]</sup>   was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_146272288_1">[1] Traditionally <I>bishop</I>; also in verse 2</A></LI>
