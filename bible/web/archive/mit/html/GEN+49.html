</DL><B>Genesis 49</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Jacob called for his sons and said: &quot;Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.<DT>4 <DD>Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Simeon and Levi are brothers-- their swords <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_1">1</a>]</sup>   are weapons of violence.<DT>6 <DD>Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.<DT>7 <DD>Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Judah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_2">2</a>]</sup>   your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you.<DT>9 <DD>You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse him?<DT>10 <DD>The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_3">3</a>]</sup>   and the obedience of the nations is his.<DT>11 <DD>He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.<DT>12 <DD>His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_4">4</a>]</sup>   <DT>13 <DD>&quot;Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;Issachar is a rawboned <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_5">5</a>]</sup>   donkey lying down between two saddlebags. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_6">6</a>]</sup>  <DT>15 <DD>When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;Dan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_7">7</a>]</sup>   will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.<DT>17 <DD>Dan will be a serpent by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;I look for your deliverance, O LORD. <DT>19 <DD>&quot;Gad <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_8">8</a>]</sup>   will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_9">9</a>]</sup>   <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_10">10</a>]</sup>  <DT>23 <DD>With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.<DT>24 <DD>But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_11">11</a>]</sup>   limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,<DT>25 <DD>because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_12">12</a>]</sup>   who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb.<DT>26 <DD>Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_13">13</a>]</sup>   the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_14">14</a>]</sup>   his brothers. <DT>27 <DD>&quot;Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.&quot; <DT>28 <DD>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.<DT>29 <DD>Then he gave them these instructions: &quot;I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<DT>30 <DD>the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.<DT>31 <DD>There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.<DT>32 <DD>The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_15">15</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>33 <DD>When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_199726480_1">[5] The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
