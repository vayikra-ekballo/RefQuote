</DL><B>Numbers 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?&quot; they asked. &quot;Hasn't he also spoken through us?&quot; And the LORD heard this.<DT>3 <DD>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)<DT>4 <DD>At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, &quot;Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you.&quot; So the three of them came out.<DT>5 <DD>Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,<DT>6 <DD>he said, &quot;Listen to my words: &quot;When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.<DT>7 <DD>But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.<DT>8 <DD>With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.<DT>10 <DD>When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam--leprous, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_1">1</a>]</sup>   like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;<DT>11 <DD>and he said to Moses, &quot;Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.<DT>12 <DD>Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>So Moses cried out to the LORD, &quot;O God, please heal her!&quot;<DT>14 <DD>The LORD replied to Moses, &quot;If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.<DT>16 <DD>After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_119860978_1">[10] The Hebrew word was used for various diseases affecting the skin--not necessarily leprosy.</A></LI>
