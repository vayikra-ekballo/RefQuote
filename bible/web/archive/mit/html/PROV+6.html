</DL><B>Proverbs 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge for another,<DT>2 <DD>if you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth,<DT>3 <DD>then do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands: Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your neighbor!<DT>4 <DD>Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.<DT>5 <DD>Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. <DT>6 <DD>Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!<DT>7 <DD>It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,<DT>8 <DD>yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest. <DT>9 <DD>How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?<DT>10 <DD>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--<DT>11 <DD>and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_112596414_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>12 <DD>A scoundrel and villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,<DT>13 <DD>who winks with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,<DT>14 <DD>who plots evil with deceit in his heart-- he always stirs up dissension.<DT>15 <DD>Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy. <DT>16 <DD>There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him:<DT>17 <DD>haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,<DT>18 <DD>a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,<DT>19 <DD>a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers. <DT>20 <DD>My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.<DT>21 <DD>Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.<DT>22 <DD>When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.<DT>23 <DD>For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,<DT>24 <DD>keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.<DT>25 <DD>Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,<DT>26 <DD>for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.<DT>27 <DD>Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?<DT>28 <DD>Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?<DT>29 <DD>So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished. <DT>30 <DD>Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.<DT>31 <DD>Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.<DT>32 <DD>But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.<DT>33 <DD>Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;<DT>34 <DD>for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.<DT>35 <DD>He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_112596414_1">[11] Or <I>like a vagrant / and scarcity like a beggar</I></A></LI>
