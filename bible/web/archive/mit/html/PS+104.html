</DL><B>Psalm 104</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 104 <DT>1 <DD>Praise the LORD, O my soul.  O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.<DT>2 <DD>He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent<DT>3 <DD>and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.<DT>4 <DD>He makes winds his messengers, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_1">1</a>]</sup>   flames of fire his servants. <DT>5 <DD>He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.<DT>6 <DD>You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.<DT>7 <DD>But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;<DT>8 <DD>they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.<DT>9 <DD>You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth. <DT>10 <DD>He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.<DT>11 <DD>They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.<DT>12 <DD>The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.<DT>13 <DD>He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.<DT>14 <DD>He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate-- bringing forth food from the earth:<DT>15 <DD>wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.<DT>16 <DD>The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.<DT>17 <DD>There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.<DT>18 <DD>The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>19 <DD>The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.<DT>20 <DD>You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.<DT>21 <DD>The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.<DT>22 <DD>The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.<DT>23 <DD>Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening. <DT>24 <DD>How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.<DT>25 <DD>There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small.<DT>26 <DD>There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there. <DT>27 <DD>These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.<DT>28 <DD>When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.<DT>29 <DD>When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.<DT>30 <DD>When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth. <DT>31 <DD>May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--<DT>32 <DD>he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke. <DT>33 <DD>I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.<DT>34 <DD>May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.<DT>35 <DD>But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more.  Praise the LORD, O my soul.  Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_138374202_3">3</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_138374202_1">[4] Or <I>angels</I></A></LI>
