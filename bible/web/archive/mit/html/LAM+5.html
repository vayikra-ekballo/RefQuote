</DL><B>Lamentations 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace.<DT>2 <DD>Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, our homes to foreigners.<DT>3 <DD>We have become orphans and fatherless, our mothers like widows.<DT>4 <DD>We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.<DT>5 <DD>Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.<DT>6 <DD>We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.<DT>7 <DD>Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.<DT>8 <DD>Slaves rule over us, and there is none to free us from their hands.<DT>9 <DD>We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.<DT>10 <DD>Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger.<DT>11 <DD>Women have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.<DT>12 <DD>Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.<DT>13 <DD>Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.<DT>14 <DD>The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.<DT>15 <DD>Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.<DT>16 <DD>The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!<DT>17 <DD>Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim<DT>18 <DD>for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it. <DT>19 <DD>You, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation.<DT>20 <DD>Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?<DT>21 <DD>Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old<DT>22 <DD>unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.  </DL><OL></OL>
