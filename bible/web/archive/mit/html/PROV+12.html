</DL><B>Proverbs 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid. <DT>2 <DD>A good man obtains favor from the LORD, but the LORD condemns a crafty man. <DT>3 <DD>A man cannot be established through wickedness, but the righteous cannot be uprooted. <DT>4 <DD>A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones. <DT>5 <DD>The plans of the righteous are just, but the advice of the wicked is deceitful. <DT>6 <DD>The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them. <DT>7 <DD>Wicked men are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous stands firm. <DT>8 <DD>A man is praised according to his wisdom, but men with warped minds are despised. <DT>9 <DD>Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant than pretend to be somebody and have no food. <DT>10 <DD>A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel. <DT>11 <DD>He who works his land will have abundant food, but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment. <DT>12 <DD>The wicked desire the plunder of evil men, but the root of the righteous flourishes. <DT>13 <DD>An evil man is trapped by his sinful talk, but a righteous man escapes trouble. <DT>14 <DD>From the fruit of his lips a man is filled with good things as surely as the work of his hands rewards him. <DT>15 <DD>The way of a fool seems right to him, but a wise man listens to advice. <DT>16 <DD>A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult. <DT>17 <DD>A truthful witness gives honest testimony, but a false witness tells lies. <DT>18 <DD>Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. <DT>19 <DD>Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment. <DT>20 <DD>There is deceit in the hearts of those who plot evil, but joy for those who promote peace. <DT>21 <DD>No harm befalls the righteous, but the wicked have their fill of trouble. <DT>22 <DD>The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in men who are truthful. <DT>23 <DD>A prudent man keeps his knowledge to himself, but the heart of fools blurts out folly. <DT>24 <DD>Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in slave labor. <DT>25 <DD>An anxious heart weighs a man down, but a kind word cheers him up. <DT>26 <DD>A righteous man is cautious in friendship, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_145809922_1">1</a>]</sup>   but the way of the wicked leads them astray. <DT>27 <DD>The lazy man does not roast <sup>[<a href="#footnote_145809922_2">2</a>]</sup>   his game, but the diligent man prizes his possessions. <DT>28 <DD>In the way of righteousness there is life; along that path is immortality. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_145809922_1">[26] Or <I>man is a guide to his neighbor</I></A></LI>
