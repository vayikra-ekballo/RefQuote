</DL><B>Proverbs 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.<DT>2 <DD>She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.<DT>3 <DD>She has sent out her maids, and she calls from the highest point of the city.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Let all who are simple come in here!&quot; she says to those who lack judgment.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.<DT>6 <DD>Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of understanding. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.<DT>8 <DD>Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you.<DT>9 <DD>Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.<DT>11 <DD>For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.<DT>12 <DD>If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.&quot; <DT>13 <DD>The woman Folly is loud; she is undisciplined and without knowledge.<DT>14 <DD>She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,<DT>15 <DD>calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way.<DT>16 <DD>&quot;Let all who are simple come in here!&quot; she says to those who lack judgment.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!&quot;<DT>18 <DD>But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_211323742_1">1</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_211323742_1">[18] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
