</DL><B>2 Timothy 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, <DT>2 <DD>To Timothy, my dear son:  Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. <DT>3 <DD>I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.<DT>4 <DD>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.<DT>5 <DD>I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.<DT>6 <DD>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.<DT>7 <DD>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.<DT>8 <DD>So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,<DT>9 <DD>who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,<DT>10 <DD>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.<DT>11 <DD>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.<DT>12 <DD>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.<DT>13 <DD>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.<DT>14 <DD>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.<DT>15 <DD>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.<DT>16 <DD>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.<DT>17 <DD>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.<DT>18 <DD>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</DL><OL></OL>
