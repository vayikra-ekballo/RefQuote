</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, &quot;I find no pleasure in them&quot;--<DT>2 <DD>before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;<DT>3 <DD>when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;<DT>4 <DD>when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;<DT>5 <DD>when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets. <DT>6 <DD>Remember him--before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well,<DT>7 <DD>and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Meaningless! Meaningless!&quot; says the Teacher. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_170415707_1">1</a>]</sup>   &quot;Everything is meaningless!&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.<DT>10 <DD>The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.<DT>11 <DD>The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails--given by one Shepherd.<DT>12 <DD>Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.<DT>13 <DD>Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole [duty] of man.<DT>14 <DD>For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_170415707_1">[8] Or <I>the leader of the assembly</I>; also in verses 9 and 10</A></LI>
