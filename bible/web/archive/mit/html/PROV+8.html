</DL><B>Proverbs 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?<DT>2 <DD>On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;<DT>3 <DD>beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud:<DT>4 <DD>&quot;To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.<DT>5 <DD>You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.<DT>6 <DD>Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.<DT>7 <DD>My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.<DT>8 <DD>All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.<DT>9 <DD>To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.<DT>10 <DD>Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,<DT>11 <DD>for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.<DT>13 <DD>To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.<DT>14 <DD>Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.<DT>15 <DD>By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;<DT>16 <DD>by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>17 <DD>I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.<DT>18 <DD>With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.<DT>19 <DD>My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.<DT>20 <DD>I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,<DT>21 <DD>bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full. <DT>22 <DD>&quot;The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_2">2</a>]</sup>   <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_3">3</a>]</sup>   before his deeds of old;<DT>23 <DD>I was appointed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_4">4</a>]</sup>   from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.<DT>24 <DD>When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;<DT>25 <DD>before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,<DT>26 <DD>before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.<DT>27 <DD>I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,<DT>28 <DD>when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,<DT>29 <DD>when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.<DT>30 <DD>Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,<DT>31 <DD>rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind. <DT>32 <DD>&quot;Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.<DT>33 <DD>Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.<DT>34 <DD>Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.<DT>35 <DD>For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.<DT>36 <DD>But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_515943273_1">[16] Many Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts <I>and nobles--all righteous rulers</I></A></LI>
