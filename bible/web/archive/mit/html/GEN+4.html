</DL><B>Genesis 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Adam <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup>   lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup>   She said, &quot;With the help of the LORD I have brought forth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_3">3</a>]</sup>   a man.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.<DT>3 <DD>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.<DT>4 <DD>But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,<DT>5 <DD>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.<DT>6 <DD>Then the LORD said to Cain, &quot;Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?<DT>7 <DD>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, &quot;Let's go out to the field.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_4">4</a>]</sup>   And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.<DT>9 <DD>Then the LORD said to Cain, &quot;Where is your brother Abel?&quot; &quot;I don't know,&quot; he replied. &quot;Am I my brother's keeper?&quot;<DT>10 <DD>The LORD said, &quot;What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.<DT>11 <DD>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.<DT>12 <DD>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Cain said to the LORD, &quot;My punishment is more than I can bear.<DT>14 <DD>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>But the LORD said to him, &quot;Not so <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_5">5</a>]</sup>  ; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.&quot; Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.<DT>16 <DD>So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_6">6</a>]</sup>   east of Eden.<DT>17 <DD>Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.<DT>18 <DD>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.<DT>19 <DD>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.<DT>20 <DD>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.<DT>21 <DD>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.<DT>22 <DD>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_7">7</a>]</sup>   bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.<DT>23 <DD>Lamech said to his wives, &quot;Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_8">8</a>]</sup>   a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.<DT>24 <DD>If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_9">9</a>]</sup>   saying, &quot;God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.&quot;<DT>26 <DD>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_10">10</a>]</sup>   the name of the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_172736232_1">[1] Or <I>The man</I></A></LI>
