</DL><B>Galatians 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.<DT>2 <DD>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.<DT>3 <DD>If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.<DT>4 <DD>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,<DT>5 <DD>for each one should carry his own load.<DT>6 <DD>Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.<DT>7 <DD>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.<DT>8 <DD>The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_1">1</a>]</sup>   will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.<DT>9 <DD>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.<DT>10 <DD>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.<DT>11 <DD>See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!<DT>12 <DD>Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.<DT>13 <DD>Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.<DT>14 <DD>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_2">2</a>]</sup>   the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<DT>15 <DD>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.<DT>16 <DD>Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.<DT>17 <DD>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.<DT>18 <DD>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_187326134_1">[8] Or <I>his flesh, from the flesh</I></A></LI>
