</DL><B>Proverbs 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD abhors dishonest scales, but accurate weights are his delight. <DT>2 <DD>When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. <DT>3 <DD>The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. <DT>4 <DD>Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. <DT>5 <DD>The righteousness of the blameless makes a straight way for them, but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness. <DT>6 <DD>The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires. <DT>7 <DD>When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes; all he expected from his power comes to nothing. <DT>8 <DD>The righteous man is rescued from trouble, and it comes on the wicked instead. <DT>9 <DD>With his mouth the godless destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous escape. <DT>10 <DD>When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy. <DT>11 <DD>Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed. <DT>12 <DD>A man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his tongue. <DT>13 <DD>A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret. <DT>14 <DD>For lack of guidance a nation falls, but many advisers make victory sure. <DT>15 <DD>He who puts up security for another will surely suffer, but whoever refuses to strike hands in pledge is safe. <DT>16 <DD>A kindhearted woman gains respect, but ruthless men gain only wealth. <DT>17 <DD>A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself. <DT>18 <DD>The wicked man earns deceptive wages, but he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. <DT>19 <DD>The truly righteous man attains life, but he who pursues evil goes to his death. <DT>20 <DD>The LORD detests men of perverse heart but he delights in those whose ways are blameless. <DT>21 <DD>Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will go free. <DT>22 <DD>Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion. <DT>23 <DD>The desire of the righteous ends only in good, but the hope of the wicked only in wrath. <DT>24 <DD>One man gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty. <DT>25 <DD>A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed. <DT>26 <DD>People curse the man who hoards grain, but blessing crowns him who is willing to sell. <DT>27 <DD>He who seeks good finds goodwill, but evil comes to him who searches for it. <DT>28 <DD>Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf. <DT>29 <DD>He who brings trouble on his family will inherit only wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise. <DT>30 <DD>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise. <DT>31 <DD>If the righteous receive their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner! </DL><OL></OL>
