</DL><B>Luke 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.<DT>2 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?<DT>3 <DD>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.<DT>4 <DD>Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?<DT>5 <DD>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Then he told this parable: &quot;A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.<DT>7 <DD>So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, `For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'<DT>8 <DD>&quot;`Sir,' the man replied, `leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.<DT>9 <DD>If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'&quot;<DT>10 <DD>On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,<DT>11 <DD>and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.<DT>12 <DD>When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.<DT>14 <DD>Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, &quot;There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The Lord answered him, &quot;You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?<DT>16 <DD>Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?&quot;<DT>17 <DD>When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.<DT>18 <DD>Then Jesus asked, &quot;What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?<DT>19 <DD>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>Again he asked, &quot;What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?<DT>21 <DD>It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount <sup>[<a href="#footnote_327778897_1">1</a>]</sup>   of flour until it worked all through the dough.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.<DT>23 <DD>Someone asked him, &quot;Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?&quot; He said to them,<DT>24 <DD>&quot;Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.<DT>25 <DD>Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, `Sir, open the door for us.' &quot;But he will answer, `I don't know you or where you come from.'<DT>26 <DD>&quot;Then you will say, `We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'<DT>27 <DD>&quot;But he will reply, `I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'<DT>28 <DD>&quot;There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.<DT>29 <DD>People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.<DT>30 <DD>Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.&quot;<DT>31 <DD>At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, &quot;Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>He replied, &quot;Go tell that fox, `I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'<DT>33 <DD>In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!<DT>34 <DD>&quot;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!<DT>35 <DD>Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, `Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_327778897_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_327778897_1">[21] Greek <I>three satas</I> (probably about 1/2 bushel or 22 liters)</A></LI>
