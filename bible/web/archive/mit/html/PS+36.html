</DL><B>Psalm 36</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 36  For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD.<DT>1 <DD>An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_1">1</a>]</sup>   There is no fear of God before his eyes.<DT>2 <DD>For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.<DT>3 <DD>The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.<DT>4 <DD>Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong. <DT>5 <DD>Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.<DT>6 <DD>Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.<DT>7 <DD>How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167405557_2">2</a>]</sup>   refuge in the shadow of your wings.<DT>8 <DD>They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.<DT>9 <DD>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. <DT>10 <DD>Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.<DT>11 <DD>May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.<DT>12 <DD>See how the evildoers lie fallen-- thrown down, not able to rise! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_167405557_1">[1] Or <I>heart:  Sin proceeds from the wicked.</I></A></LI>
