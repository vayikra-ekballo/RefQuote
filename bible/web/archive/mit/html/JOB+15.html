</DL><B>Job 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?<DT>3 <DD>Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?<DT>4 <DD>But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.<DT>5 <DD>Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.<DT>6 <DD>Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?<DT>8 <DD>Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?<DT>9 <DD>What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?<DT>10 <DD>The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.<DT>11 <DD>Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?<DT>12 <DD>Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,<DT>13 <DD>so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth? <DT>14 <DD>&quot;What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?<DT>15 <DD>If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,<DT>16 <DD>how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water! <DT>17 <DD>&quot;Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,<DT>18 <DD>what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers<DT>19 <DD>(to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them):<DT>20 <DD>All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.<DT>21 <DD>Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.<DT>22 <DD>He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.<DT>23 <DD>He wanders about--food for vultures <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.<DT>24 <DD>Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,<DT>25 <DD>because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,<DT>26 <DD>defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield. <DT>27 <DD>&quot;Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,<DT>28 <DD>he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.<DT>29 <DD>He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.<DT>30 <DD>He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.<DT>31 <DD>Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.<DT>32 <DD>Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.<DT>33 <DD>He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.<DT>34 <DD>For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.<DT>35 <DD>They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_129182958_1">[23] Or <I>about, looking for food</I></A></LI>
