Over it they are to spread a covering of hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the Tent of Meeting.<DT>16 <DD>&quot;Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,<DT>18 <DD>&quot;See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not cut off from the Levites.<DT>19 <DD>So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry.<DT>20 <DD>But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>22 <DD>&quot;Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.<DT>23 <DD>Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;This is the service of the Gershonite clans as they work and carry burdens:<DT>25 <DD>They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering and the outer covering of hides of sea cows, the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,<DT>26 <DD>the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its service. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.<DT>27 <DD>All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry.<DT>28 <DD>This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.<DT>29 <DD>&quot;Count the Merarites by their clans and families.<DT>30 <DD>Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.<DT>31 <DD>This is their duty as they perform service at the Tent of Meeting: to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases,<DT>32 <DD>as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, all their equipment and everything related to their use. Assign to each man the specific things he is to carry.<DT>33 <DD>This is the service of the Merarite clans as they work at the Tent of Meeting under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.&quot;<DT>34 <DD>Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families.<DT>35 <DD>All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting,<DT>36 <DD>counted by clans, were 2,750.<DT>37 <DD>This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served in the Tent of Meeting.
