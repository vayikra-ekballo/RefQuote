</DL><B>Numbers 25</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,<DT>2 <DD>who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate and bowed down before these gods.<DT>3 <DD>So Israel joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor. And the LORD's anger burned against them.<DT>4 <DD>The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the LORD's fierce anger may turn away from Israel.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>So Moses said to Israel's judges, &quot;Each of you must put to death those of your men who have joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Then an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.<DT>7 <DD>When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand<DT>8 <DD>and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear through both of them--through the Israelite and into the woman's body. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;<DT>9 <DD>but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.<DT>10 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites; for he was as zealous as I am for my honor among them, so that in my zeal I did not put an end to them.<DT>12 <DD>Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.<DT>13 <DD>He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.<DT>15 <DD>And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.<DT>16 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them,<DT>18 <DD>because they treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the affair of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of Peor.&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
