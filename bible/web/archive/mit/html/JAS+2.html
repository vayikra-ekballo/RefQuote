</DL><B>James 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.<DT>2 <DD>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.<DT>3 <DD>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, &quot;Here's a good seat for you,&quot; but say to the poor man, &quot;You stand there&quot; or &quot;Sit on the floor by my feet,&quot;<DT>4 <DD>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?<DT>5 <DD>Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?<DT>6 <DD>But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?<DT>7 <DD>Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?<DT>8 <DD>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup>   you are doing right.<DT>9 <DD>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.<DT>10 <DD>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.<DT>11 <DD>For he who said, &quot;Do not commit adultery,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup>   also said, &quot;Do not murder.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_3">3</a>]</sup>   If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.<DT>12 <DD>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,<DT>13 <DD>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!<DT>14 <DD>What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?<DT>15 <DD>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.<DT>16 <DD>If one of you says to him, &quot;Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,&quot; but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?<DT>17 <DD>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.<DT>18 <DD>But someone will say, &quot;You have faith; I have deeds.&quot; Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.<DT>19 <DD>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.<DT>20 <DD>You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_4">4</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>21 <DD>Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?<DT>22 <DD>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.<DT>23 <DD>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_5">5</a>]</sup>   and he was called God's friend.<DT>24 <DD>You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.<DT>25 <DD>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?<DT>26 <DD>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_111776534_1">[8] Lev. 19:18</A></LI>
