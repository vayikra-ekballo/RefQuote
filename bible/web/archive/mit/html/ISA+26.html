</DL><B>Isaiah 26</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.<DT>2 <DD>Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith.<DT>3 <DD>You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you.<DT>4 <DD>Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD, is the Rock eternal.<DT>5 <DD>He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.<DT>6 <DD>Feet trample it down-- the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor. <DT>7 <DD>The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth.<DT>8 <DD>Yes, LORD, walking in the way of your laws, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_1">1</a>]</sup>   we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.<DT>9 <DD>My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.<DT>10 <DD>Though grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the LORD.<DT>11 <DD>O LORD, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them. <DT>12 <DD>LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us.<DT>13 <DD>O LORD, our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.<DT>14 <DD>They are now dead, they live no more; those departed spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.<DT>15 <DD>You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land. <DT>16 <DD>LORD, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>17 <DD>As a woman with child and about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, O LORD.<DT>18 <DD>We were with child, we writhed in pain, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth; we have not given birth to people of the world. <DT>19 <DD>But your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead. <DT>20 <DD>Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.<DT>21 <DD>See, the LORD is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her; she will conceal her slain no longer.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_565097987_1">[8] Or <I>judgments</I></A></LI>
