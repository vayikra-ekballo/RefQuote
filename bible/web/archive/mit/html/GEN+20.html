</DL><B>Genesis 20</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,<DT>2 <DD>and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, &quot;She is my sister.&quot; Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.<DT>3 <DD>But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, &quot;You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, &quot;Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?<DT>5 <DD>Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Then God said to him in the dream, &quot;Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.<DT>7 <DD>Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will die.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.<DT>9 <DD>Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, &quot;What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>And Abimelech asked Abraham, &quot;What was your reason for doing this?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Abraham replied, &quot;I said to myself, `There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'<DT>12 <DD>Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.<DT>13 <DD>And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, `This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, &quot;He is my brother.&quot;'&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.<DT>15 <DD>And Abimelech said, &quot;My land is before you; live wherever you like.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>To Sarah he said, &quot;I am giving your brother a thousand shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_1">1</a>]</sup>   of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again,<DT>18 <DD>for the LORD had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115870484_1">[16] That is, about 25 pounds (about 11.5 kilograms)</A></LI>
