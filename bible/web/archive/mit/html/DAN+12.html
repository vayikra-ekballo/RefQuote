</DL><B>Daniel 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people--everyone whose name is found written in the book--will be delivered.<DT>2 <DD>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.<DT>3 <DD>Those who are wise <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_1">1</a>]</sup>   will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.<DT>4 <DD>But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.&quot; <DT>5 <DD>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.<DT>6 <DD>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, &quot;How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?&quot;<DT>7 <DD>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, &quot;It will be for a time, times and half a time. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_2">2</a>]</sup>   When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, &quot;My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>He replied, &quot;Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.<DT>10 <DD>Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.<DT>12 <DD>Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_142197556_1">[3] Or <I>who impart wisdom</I></A></LI>
