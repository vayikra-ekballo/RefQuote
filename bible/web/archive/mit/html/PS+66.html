</DL><B>Psalm 66</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 66  For the director of music. A song. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>Shout with joy to God, all the earth!<DT>2 <DD>Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious!<DT>3 <DD>Say to God, &quot;How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.<DT>4 <DD>All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing praise to your name.&quot; Selah <DT>5 <DD>Come and see what God has done, how awesome his works in man's behalf!<DT>6 <DD>He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot-- come, let us rejoice in him.<DT>7 <DD>He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations-- let not the rebellious rise up against him. Selah <DT>8 <DD>Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;<DT>9 <DD>he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.<DT>10 <DD>For you, O God, tested us; you refined us like silver.<DT>11 <DD>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.<DT>12 <DD>You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance. <DT>13 <DD>I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you--<DT>14 <DD>vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.<DT>15 <DD>I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah <DT>16 <DD>Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.<DT>17 <DD>I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.<DT>18 <DD>If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;<DT>19 <DD>but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer.<DT>20 <DD>Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me! </DL><OL></OL>
