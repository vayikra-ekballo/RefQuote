</DL><B>Luke 18</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.<DT>2 <DD>He said: &quot;In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.<DT>3 <DD>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, `Grant me justice against my adversary.'<DT>4 <DD>&quot;For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, `Even though I don't fear God or care about men,<DT>5 <DD>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'&quot;<DT>6 <DD>And the Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unjust judge says.<DT>7 <DD>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?<DT>8 <DD>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:<DT>10 <DD>&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.<DT>11 <DD>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about <sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_1">1</a>]</sup>   himself: `God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.<DT>12 <DD>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'<DT>13 <DD>&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, `God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'<DT>14 <DD>&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.<DT>16 <DD>But Jesus called the children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.<DT>17 <DD>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>A certain ruler asked him, &quot;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Why do you call me good?&quot; Jesus answered. &quot;No one is good--except God alone.<DT>20 <DD>You know the commandments: `Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>21 <DD>&quot;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&quot; he said.<DT>22 <DD>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.<DT>24 <DD>Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!<DT>25 <DD>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;<DT>26 <DD>Those who heard this asked, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot;<DT>27 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;What is impossible with men is possible with God.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Peter said to him, &quot;We have left all we had to follow you!&quot;<DT>29 <DD>&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God<DT>30 <DD>will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.&quot;<DT>31 <DD>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, &quot;We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.<DT>32 <DD>He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.<DT>33 <DD>On the third day he will rise again.&quot;<DT>34 <DD>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.<DT>35 <DD>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.<DT>36 <DD>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.<DT>37 <DD>They told him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&quot;<DT>38 <DD>He called out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;<DT>39 <DD>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;<DT>40 <DD>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,<DT>41 <DD>&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; &quot;Lord, I want to see,&quot; he replied.<DT>42 <DD>Jesus said to him, &quot;Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.&quot;<DT>43 <DD>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_947371799_1">[11] Or <I>to</I></A></LI>
