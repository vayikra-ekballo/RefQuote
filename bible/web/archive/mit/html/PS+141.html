</DL><B>Psalm 141</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 141  A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD, I call to you; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you.<DT>2 <DD>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. <DT>3 <DD>Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.<DT>4 <DD>Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers; let me not eat of their delicacies. <DT>5 <DD>Let a righteous man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_878711724_1">1</a>]</sup>   strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it.  Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;<DT>6 <DD>their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.<DT>7 <DD>[They will say,] &quot;As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_878711724_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot; <DT>8 <DD>But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge--do not give me over to death.<DT>9 <DD>Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, from the traps set by evildoers.<DT>10 <DD>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_878711724_1">[5] Or <I>Let the Righteous One</I></A></LI>
