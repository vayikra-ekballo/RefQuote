</DL><B>Isaiah 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror. <DT>2 <DD>A dire vision has been shown to me: The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused. <DT>3 <DD>At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see.<DT>4 <DD>My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me. <DT>5 <DD>They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields!<DT>6 <DD>This is what the Lord says to me: &quot;Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.<DT>7 <DD>When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>And the lookout <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup>   shouted, &quot;Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.<DT>9 <DD>Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer: `Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!'&quot; <DT>10 <DD>O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD Almighty, from the God of Israel. <DT>11 <DD>An oracle concerning Dumah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup>  : Someone calls to me from Seir, &quot;Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?&quot;<DT>12 <DD>The watchman replies, &quot;Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>An oracle concerning Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,<DT>14 <DD>bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.<DT>15 <DD>They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.<DT>16 <DD>This is what the Lord says to me: &quot;Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.<DT>17 <DD>The survivors of the bowmen, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.&quot; The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_100880827_1">[8] Dead Sea Scrolls and Syriac; Masoretic Text <I>A lion</I></A></LI>
