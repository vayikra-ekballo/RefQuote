</DL><B>Ezekiel 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.<DT>2 <DD>The LORD said to me, &quot;Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.<DT>3 <DD>They say, `Will it not soon be time to build houses? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup>   This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.'<DT>4 <DD>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon me, and he told me to say: &quot;This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, O house of Israel, but I know what is going through your mind.<DT>6 <DD>You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it.<DT>8 <DD>You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD.<DT>9 <DD>I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you.<DT>10 <DD>You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.<DT>11 <DD>This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.<DT>12 <DD>And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, &quot;Ah, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?&quot;<DT>14 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>15 <DD>&quot;Son of man, your brothers--your brothers who are your blood relatives <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup>   and the whole house of Israel--are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, `They are <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup>   far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.'<DT>16 <DD>&quot;Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.'<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Therefore say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.'<DT>18 <DD>&quot;They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.<DT>19 <DD>I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.<DT>20 <DD>Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God.<DT>21 <DD>But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.<DT>23 <DD>The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.<DT>24 <DD>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup>   in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,<DT>25 <DD>and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_471171087_1">[3] Or <I>This is not the time to build houses.</I></A></LI>
