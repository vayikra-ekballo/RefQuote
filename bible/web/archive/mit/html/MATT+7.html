</DL><B>Matthew 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Do not judge, or you too will be judged.<DT>2 <DD>For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.<DT>3 <DD>&quot;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?<DT>4 <DD>How can you say to your brother, `Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?<DT>5 <DD>You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.<DT>8 <DD>For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?<DT>10 <DD>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?<DT>11 <DD>If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!<DT>12 <DD>So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.<DT>14 <DD>But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.<DT>16 <DD>By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?<DT>17 <DD>Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.<DT>18 <DD>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.<DT>19 <DD>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<DT>20 <DD>Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.<DT>22 <DD>Many will say to me on that day, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'<DT>23 <DD>Then I will tell them plainly, `I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'<DT>24 <DD>&quot;Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.<DT>25 <DD>The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.<DT>26 <DD>But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.<DT>27 <DD>The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.&quot; <DT>28 <DD>When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,<DT>29 <DD>because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.</DL><OL></OL>
