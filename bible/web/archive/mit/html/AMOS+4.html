</DL><B>Amos 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, &quot;Bring us some drinks!&quot;<DT>2 <DD>The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness: &quot;The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks.<DT>3 <DD>You will each go straight out through breaks in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup>  &quot; declares the LORD.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings-- boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do,&quot; declares the Sovereign LORD.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;I gave you empty stomachs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_3">3</a>]</sup>   in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up.<DT>8 <DD>People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, I struck them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;I overthrew some of you as I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_4">4</a>]</sup>   overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>12 <DD>&quot;Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>He who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to man, he who turns dawn to darkness, and treads the high places of the earth-- the LORD God Almighty is his name.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_121071346_1">[3] Masoretic Text; with a different word division of the Hebrew (see Septuagint) <I>out, O mountain of oppression</I></A></LI>
