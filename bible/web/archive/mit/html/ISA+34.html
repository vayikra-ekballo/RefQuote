</DL><B>Isaiah 34</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it!<DT>2 <DD>The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is upon all their armies. He will totally destroy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   them, he will give them over to slaughter.<DT>3 <DD>Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will send up a stench; the mountains will be soaked with their blood.<DT>4 <DD>All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. <DT>5 <DD>My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed.<DT>6 <DD>The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat-- the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom.<DT>7 <DD>And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat. <DT>8 <DD>For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion's cause.<DT>9 <DD>Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch!<DT>10 <DD>It will not be quenched night and day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.<DT>11 <DD>The desert owl <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup>   and screech owl <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_3">3</a>]</sup>   will possess it; the great owl <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_4">4</a>]</sup>   and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.<DT>12 <DD>Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away.<DT>13 <DD>Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.<DT>14 <DD>Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also repose and find for themselves places of rest.<DT>15 <DD>The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate.<DT>16 <DD>Look in the scroll of the LORD and read: None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For it is his mouth that has given the order, and his Spirit will gather them together.<DT>17 <DD>He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[2] The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the LORD, often by totally destroying them; also in verse 5.</A></LI>
