</DL><B>Isaiah 38</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, &quot;This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,<DT>3 <DD>&quot;Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&quot; And Hezekiah wept bitterly.<DT>4 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:<DT>5 <DD>&quot;Go and tell Hezekiah, `This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.<DT>6 <DD>And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;`This is the LORD's sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised:<DT>8 <DD>I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.'&quot; So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down. <DT>9 <DD>A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:<DT>10 <DD>I said, &quot;In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_1">1</a>]</sup>   and be robbed of the rest of my years?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>I said, &quot;I will not again see the LORD, the LORD, in the land of the living; no longer will I look on mankind, or be with those who now dwell in this world. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>12 <DD>Like a shepherd's tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me.<DT>13 <DD>I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me.<DT>14 <DD>I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am troubled; O Lord, come to my aid!&quot; <DT>15 <DD>But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul.<DT>16 <DD>Lord, by such things men live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live.<DT>17 <DD>Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.<DT>18 <DD>For the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_3">3</a>]</sup>   cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.<DT>19 <DD>The living, the living--they praise you, as I am doing today; fathers tell their children about your faithfulness. <DT>20 <DD>The LORD will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the LORD.<DT>21 <DD>Isaiah had said, &quot;Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Hezekiah had asked, &quot;What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the LORD?&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_142540437_1">[10] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
