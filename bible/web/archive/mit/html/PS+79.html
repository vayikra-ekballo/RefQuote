</DL><B>Psalm 79</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 79  A psalm of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.<DT>2 <DD>They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.<DT>3 <DD>They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.<DT>4 <DD>We are objects of reproach to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us. <DT>5 <DD>How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?<DT>6 <DD>Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;<DT>7 <DD>for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.<DT>8 <DD>Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need. <DT>9 <DD>Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.<DT>10 <DD>Why should the nations say, &quot;Where is their God?&quot; Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.<DT>11 <DD>May the groans of the prisoners come before you; by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die. <DT>12 <DD>Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you, O Lord.<DT>13 <DD>Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise. </DL><OL></OL>
