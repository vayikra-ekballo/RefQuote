</DL><B>Job 23</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup>   is heavy in spite of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup>   my groaning.<DT>3 <DD>If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!<DT>4 <DD>I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.<DT>5 <DD>I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.<DT>6 <DD>Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.<DT>7 <DD>There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.<DT>9 <DD>When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.<DT>10 <DD>But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.<DT>11 <DD>My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.<DT>12 <DD>I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.<DT>14 <DD>He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.<DT>15 <DD>That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.<DT>16 <DD>God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.<DT>17 <DD>Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_100880827_1">[2] Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew  <I>the hand on me</I></A></LI>
