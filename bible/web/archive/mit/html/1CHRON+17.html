</DL><B>1 Chronicles 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, &quot;Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Nathan replied to David, &quot;Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>That night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Go and tell my servant David, `This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.<DT>5 <DD>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.<DT>6 <DD>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders <sup>[<a href="#footnote_822374082_1">1</a>]</sup>   whom I commanded to shepherd my people, &quot;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&quot;'<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Now then, tell my servant David, `This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.<DT>8 <DD>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.<DT>9 <DD>And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning<DT>10 <DD>and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. &quot;`I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you:<DT>11 <DD>When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.<DT>12 <DD>He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.<DT>13 <DD>I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.<DT>14 <DD>I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.'&quot; <DT>15 <DD>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. <DT>16 <DD>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said:  &quot;Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?<DT>17 <DD>And as if this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O LORD God.<DT>18 <DD>&quot;What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,<DT>19 <DD>O LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.<DT>20 <DD>&quot;There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.<DT>21 <DD>And who is like your people Israel--the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?<DT>22 <DD>You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.<DT>23 <DD>&quot;And now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,<DT>24 <DD>so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, `The LORD Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.<DT>26 <DD>O LORD, you are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.<DT>27 <DD>Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_822374082_1">[6] Traditionally <I>judges</I>; also in verse 10</A></LI>
