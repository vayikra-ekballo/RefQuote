</DL><B>Matthew 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.<DT>2 <DD>After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.<DT>3 <DD>The tempter came to him and said, &quot;If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;It is written: `Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>5 <DD>Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;If you are the Son of God,&quot; he said, &quot;throw yourself down. For it is written: &quot;`He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>7 <DD>Jesus answered him, &quot;It is also written: `Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>8 <DD>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;All this I will give you,&quot; he said, &quot;if you will bow down and worship me.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is written: `Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>11 <DD>Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.<DT>12 <DD>When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.<DT>13 <DD>Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--<DT>14 <DD>to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:<DT>15 <DD>&quot;Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--<DT>16 <DD>the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>17 <DD>From that time on Jesus began to preach, &quot;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Come, follow me,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;and I will make you fishers of men.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>At once they left their nets and followed him.<DT>21 <DD>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,<DT>22 <DD>and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.<DT>23 <DD>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.<DT>24 <DD>News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.<DT>25 <DD>Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_6">6</a>]</sup>   Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_471171087_1">[4] Deut. 8:3</A></LI>
