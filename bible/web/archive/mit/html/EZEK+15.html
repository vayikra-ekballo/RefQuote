</DL><B>Ezekiel 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, how is the wood of a vine better than that of a branch on any of the trees in the forest?<DT>3 <DD>Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?<DT>4 <DD>And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?<DT>5 <DD>If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.<DT>7 <DD>I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD.<DT>8 <DD>I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD.&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
