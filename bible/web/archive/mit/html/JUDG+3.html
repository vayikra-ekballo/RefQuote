</DL><B>Judges 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan<DT>2 <DD>(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):<DT>3 <DD>the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_1">1</a>]</sup>   Hamath.<DT>4 <DD>They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD's commands, which he had given their forefathers through Moses.<DT>5 <DD>The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.<DT>6 <DD>They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<DT>7 <DD>The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.<DT>8 <DD>The anger of the LORD burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_2">2</a>]</sup>   to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.<DT>9 <DD>But when they cried out to the LORD, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.<DT>10 <DD>The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, so that he became Israel's judge <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_3">3</a>]</sup>   and went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.<DT>11 <DD>So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.<DT>12 <DD>Once again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and because they did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.<DT>13 <DD>Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.<DT>15 <DD>Again the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he gave them a deliverer--Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.<DT>16 <DD>Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_5">5</a>]</sup>   long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.<DT>17 <DD>He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.<DT>18 <DD>After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way the men who had carried it.<DT>19 <DD>At the idols <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_6">6</a>]</sup>   near Gilgal he himself turned back and said, &quot;I have a secret message for you, O king.&quot; The king said, &quot;Quiet!&quot; And all his attendants left him.<DT>20 <DD>Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_7">7</a>]</sup>   and said, &quot;I have a message from God for you.&quot; As the king rose from his seat,<DT>21 <DD>Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly.<DT>22 <DD>Even the handle sank in after the blade, which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.<DT>23 <DD>Then Ehud went out to the porch <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_8">8</a>]</sup>  ; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.<DT>24 <DD>After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, &quot;He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the house.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.<DT>26 <DD>While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.<DT>27 <DD>When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.<DT>28 <DD>&quot;Follow me,&quot; he ordered, &quot;for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.&quot; So they followed him down and, taking possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab, they allowed no one to cross over.<DT>29 <DD>At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not a man escaped.<DT>30 <DD>That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.<DT>31 <DD>After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_125000557_1">[3] Or <I>to the entrance to</I></A></LI>
