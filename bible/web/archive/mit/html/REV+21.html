</DL><B>Revelation 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.<DT>2 <DD>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.<DT>3 <DD>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, &quot;Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.<DT>4 <DD>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>He who was seated on the throne said, &quot;I am making everything new!&quot; Then he said, &quot;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>He said to me: &quot;It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.<DT>7 <DD>He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.<DT>8 <DD>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, &quot;Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.<DT>11 <DD>It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.<DT>12 <DD>It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.<DT>13 <DD>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.<DT>14 <DD>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<DT>15 <DD>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.<DT>16 <DD>The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia <sup>[<a href="#footnote_151492122_1">1</a>]</sup>   in length, and as wide and high as it is long.<DT>17 <DD>He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits <sup>[<a href="#footnote_151492122_2">2</a>]</sup>   thick, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_151492122_3">3</a>]</sup>   by man's measurement, which the angel was using.<DT>18 <DD>The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.<DT>19 <DD>The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,<DT>20 <DD>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_151492122_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>21 <DD>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.<DT>22 <DD>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<DT>23 <DD>The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.<DT>24 <DD>The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.<DT>25 <DD>On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.<DT>26 <DD>The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.<DT>27 <DD>Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_151492122_1">[16] That is, about 1,400 miles (about 2,200 kilometers)</A></LI>
