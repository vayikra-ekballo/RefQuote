</DL><B>John 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<DT>2 <DD>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.<DT>3 <DD>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group<DT>4 <DD>and said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.<DT>5 <DD>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.<DT>7 <DD>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, &quot;If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.<DT>9 <DD>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.<DT>10 <DD>Jesus straightened up and asked her, &quot;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>&quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, &quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>The Pharisees challenged him, &quot;Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.<DT>15 <DD>You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.<DT>16 <DD>But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.<DT>17 <DD>In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.<DT>18 <DD>I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>Then they asked him, &quot;Where is your father?&quot; &quot;You do not know me or my Father,&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.<DT>21 <DD>Once more Jesus said to them, &quot;I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>This made the Jews ask, &quot;Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, `Where I go, you cannot come'?&quot;<DT>23 <DD>But he continued, &quot;You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.<DT>24 <DD>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am [the one I claim to be], <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup>   you will indeed die in your sins.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>&quot;Who are you?&quot; they asked. &quot;Just what I have been claiming all along,&quot; Jesus replied.<DT>26 <DD>&quot;I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.<DT>28 <DD>So Jesus said, &quot;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [the one I claim to be] and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.<DT>29 <DD>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.<DT>31 <DD>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, &quot;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.<DT>32 <DD>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>They answered him, &quot;We are Abraham's descendants <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_2">2</a>]</sup>   and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?&quot;<DT>34 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.<DT>35 <DD>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.<DT>36 <DD>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.<DT>37 <DD>I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.<DT>38 <DD>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_3">3</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>39 <DD>&quot;Abraham is our father,&quot; they answered. &quot;If you were Abraham's children,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;then you would <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_4">4</a>]</sup>   do the things Abraham did.<DT>40 <DD>As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.<DT>41 <DD>You are doing the things your own father does.&quot; &quot;We are not illegitimate children,&quot; they protested. &quot;The only Father we have is God himself.&quot;<DT>42 <DD>Jesus said to them, &quot;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.<DT>43 <DD>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.<DT>44 <DD>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.<DT>45 <DD>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!<DT>46 <DD>Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?<DT>47 <DD>He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.&quot;<DT>48 <DD>The Jews answered him, &quot;Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?&quot;<DT>49 <DD>&quot;I am not possessed by a demon,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.<DT>50 <DD>I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.<DT>51 <DD>I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.&quot;<DT>52 <DD>At this the Jews exclaimed, &quot;Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.<DT>53 <DD>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?&quot;<DT>54 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.<DT>55 <DD>Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.<DT>56 <DD>Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.&quot;<DT>57 <DD>&quot;You are not yet fifty years old,&quot; the Jews said to him, &quot;and you have seen Abraham!&quot;<DT>58 <DD>&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;before Abraham was born, I am!&quot;<DT>59 <DD>At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305023583_1">[24] Or <I>I am he</I>; also in verse 28</A></LI>
