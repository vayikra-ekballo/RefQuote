</DL><B>Joel 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel. <DT>2 <DD>Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your forefathers?<DT>3 <DD>Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.<DT>4 <DD>What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_1">1</a>]</sup>   have eaten. <DT>5 <DD>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips.<DT>6 <DD>A nation has invaded my land, powerful and without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness.<DT>7 <DD>It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white. <DT>8 <DD>Mourn like a virgin <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_2">2</a>]</sup>   in sackcloth grieving for the husband <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_3">3</a>]</sup>   of her youth.<DT>9 <DD>Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.<DT>10 <DD>The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_4">4</a>]</sup>  ; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil fails.<DT>11 <DD>Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.<DT>12 <DD>The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree-- all the trees of the field--are dried up. Surely the joy of mankind is withered away. <DT>13 <DD>Put on sackcloth, O priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.<DT>14 <DD>Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD. <DT>15 <DD>Alas for that day! For the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_5">5</a>]</sup>   <DT>16 <DD>Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes-- joy and gladness from the house of our God?<DT>17 <DD>The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_731479488_6">6</a>]</sup>   The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up.<DT>18 <DD>How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering. <DT>19 <DD>To you, O LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the open pastures and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.<DT>20 <DD>Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the open pastures. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_731479488_1"><I>4</I> The precise meaning of the four Hebrew words used here for locusts is uncertain.</A></LI>
