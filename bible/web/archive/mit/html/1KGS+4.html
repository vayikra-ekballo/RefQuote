These countries brought tribute and were Solomon's subjects all his life.<DT>22 <DD>Solomon's daily provisions were thirty cors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_3">3</a>]</sup>   of fine flour and sixty cors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_4">4</a>]</sup>   of meal,<DT>23 <DD>ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl.<DT>24 <DD>For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides.<DT>25 <DD>During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, each man under his own vine and fig tree.<DT>26 <DD>Solomon had four <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_5">5</a>]</sup>   thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_6">6</a>]</sup>  <DT>27 <DD>The district officers, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king's table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.<DT>28 <DD>They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.<DT>29 <DD>God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore.<DT>30 <DD>Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.<DT>31 <DD>He was wiser than any other man, including Ethan the Ezrahite--wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.<DT>32 <DD>He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.<DT>33 <DD>He described plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also taught about animals and birds, reptiles and fish.<DT>34 <DD>Men of all nations came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_533091100_1">[11] Or <I>in the heights of Dor</I></A></LI>
