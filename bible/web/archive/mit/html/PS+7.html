</DL><B>Psalm 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 7  A shiggaion <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_1">1</a>]</sup>   of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjamite.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,<DT>2 <DD>or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. <DT>3 <DD>O LORD my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands--<DT>4 <DD>if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe--<DT>5 <DD>then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.  Selah <DT>6 <DD>Arise, O LORD, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.<DT>7 <DD>Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high;<DT>8 <DD>let the LORD judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.<DT>9 <DD>O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure. <DT>10 <DD>My shield <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_2">2</a>]</sup>   is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.<DT>11 <DD>God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day.<DT>12 <DD>If he does not relent, he <sup>[<a href="#footnote_818837148_3">3</a>]</sup>   will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.<DT>13 <DD>He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows. <DT>14 <DD>He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment.<DT>15 <DD>He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made.<DT>16 <DD>The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head. <DT>17 <DD>I will give thanks to the LORD because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_818837148_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
