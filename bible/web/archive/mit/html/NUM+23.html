</DL><B>Numbers 23</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Balaam said, &quot;Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.<DT>3 <DD>Then Balaam said to Balak, &quot;Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.&quot; Then he went off to a barren height.<DT>4 <DD>God met with him, and Balaam said, &quot;I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>The LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, &quot;Go back to Balak and give him this message.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.<DT>7 <DD>Then Balaam uttered his oracle: &quot;Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. `Come,' he said, `curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'<DT>8 <DD>How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?<DT>9 <DD>From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.<DT>10 <DD>Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Balak said to Balaam, &quot;What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!&quot;<DT>12 <DD>He answered, &quot;Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then Balak said to him, &quot;Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.<DT>15 <DD>Balaam said to Balak, &quot;Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, &quot;Go back to Balak and give him this message.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, &quot;What did the LORD say?&quot;<DT>18 <DD>Then he uttered his oracle: &quot;Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.<DT>19 <DD>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?<DT>20 <DD>I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_105861046_1">1</a>]</sup>   The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.<DT>22 <DD>God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.<DT>23 <DD>There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, `See what God has done!'<DT>24 <DD>The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>Then Balak said to Balaam, &quot;Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!&quot;<DT>26 <DD>Balaam answered, &quot;Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?&quot;<DT>27 <DD>Then Balak said to Balaam, &quot;Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.<DT>29 <DD>Balaam said, &quot;Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_105861046_1">[21] Or <I>He has not looked on Jacob's offenses  or on the wrongs found in Israel</I>.</A></LI>
