</DL><B>Job 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.<DT>3 <DD>Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?<DT>5 <DD>Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.<DT>6 <DD>When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.<DT>7 <DD>Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?<DT>8 <DD>They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.<DT>9 <DD>Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.<DT>10 <DD>Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.<DT>11 <DD>They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.<DT>12 <DD>They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.<DT>13 <DD>They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_1">1</a>]</sup>   in peace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>Yet they say to God, `Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.<DT>15 <DD>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'<DT>16 <DD>But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked. <DT>17 <DD>&quot;Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?<DT>18 <DD>How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?<DT>19 <DD>[It is said,] `God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!<DT>20 <DD>Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>21 <DD>For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end? <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?<DT>23 <DD>One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,<DT>24 <DD>his body <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_4">4</a>]</sup>   well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.<DT>25 <DD>Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.<DT>26 <DD>Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both. <DT>27 <DD>&quot;I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.<DT>28 <DD>You say, `Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'<DT>29 <DD>Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts--<DT>30 <DD>that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_5">5</a>]</sup>   the day of wrath?<DT>31 <DD>Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?<DT>32 <DD>He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.<DT>33 <DD>The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_6">6</a>]</sup>   before him. <DT>34 <DD>&quot;So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161676293_1">[13] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
