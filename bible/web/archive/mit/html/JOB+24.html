</DL><B>Job 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?<DT>2 <DD>Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.<DT>3 <DD>They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.<DT>4 <DD>They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.<DT>5 <DD>Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.<DT>6 <DD>They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.<DT>7 <DD>Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.<DT>8 <DD>They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.<DT>9 <DD>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.<DT>10 <DD>Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.<DT>11 <DD>They crush olives among the terraces <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.<DT>12 <DD>The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.<DT>14 <DD>When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.<DT>15 <DD>The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, `No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.<DT>16 <DD>In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.<DT>17 <DD>For all of them, deep darkness is their morning <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; they make friends with the terrors of darkness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_3">3</a>]</sup>   <DT>18 <DD>&quot;Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.<DT>19 <DD>As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_4">4</a>]</sup>   snatches away those who have sinned.<DT>20 <DD>The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.<DT>21 <DD>They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.<DT>22 <DD>But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.<DT>23 <DD>He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.<DT>24 <DD>For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain. <DT>25 <DD>&quot;If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_717090538_1">[11] Or <I>olives between the millstones</I>; the meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
