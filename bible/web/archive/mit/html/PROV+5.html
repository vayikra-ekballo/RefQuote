</DL><B>Proverbs 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,<DT>2 <DD>that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.<DT>3 <DD>For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;<DT>4 <DD>but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.<DT>5 <DD>Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>6 <DD>She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not. <DT>7 <DD>Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.<DT>8 <DD>Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,<DT>9 <DD>lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,<DT>10 <DD>lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.<DT>11 <DD>At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.<DT>12 <DD>You will say, &quot;How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!<DT>13 <DD>I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.<DT>14 <DD>I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.&quot; <DT>15 <DD>Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.<DT>16 <DD>Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?<DT>17 <DD>Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.<DT>18 <DD>May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.<DT>19 <DD>A loving doe, a graceful deer-- may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.<DT>20 <DD>Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife? <DT>21 <DD>For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.<DT>22 <DD>The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.<DT>23 <DD>He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_143354100_1">[5] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
