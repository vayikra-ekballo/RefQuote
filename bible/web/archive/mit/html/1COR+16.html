</DL><B>1 Corinthians 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now about the collection for God's people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.<DT>2 <DD>On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.<DT>3 <DD>Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.<DT>4 <DD>If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.<DT>5 <DD>After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you--for I will be going through Macedonia.<DT>6 <DD>Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.<DT>7 <DD>I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.<DT>8 <DD>But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,<DT>9 <DD>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.<DT>10 <DD>If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.<DT>11 <DD>No one, then, should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.<DT>12 <DD>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.<DT>13 <DD>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.<DT>14 <DD>Do everything in love.<DT>15 <DD>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers,<DT>16 <DD>to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it.<DT>17 <DD>I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.<DT>18 <DD>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.<DT>19 <DD>The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla<sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_1">1</a>]</sup>  greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.<DT>20 <DD>All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.<DT>21 <DD>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.<DT>22 <DD>If anyone does not love the Lord--a curse be on him. Come, O Lord<sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_2">2</a>]</sup> !<DT>23 <DD>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.<DT>24 <DD>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.
