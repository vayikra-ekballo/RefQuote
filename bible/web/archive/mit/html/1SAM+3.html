</DL><B>1 Samuel 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.<DT>2 <DD>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.<DT>3 <DD>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple <sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_1">1</a>]</sup>   of the LORD, where the ark of God was.<DT>4 <DD>Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, &quot;Here I am.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>And he ran to Eli and said, &quot;Here I am; you called me.&quot; But Eli said, &quot;I did not call; go back and lie down.&quot; So he went and lay down.<DT>6 <DD>Again the LORD called, &quot;Samuel!&quot; And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &quot;Here I am; you called me.&quot; &quot;My son,&quot; Eli said, &quot;I did not call; go back and lie down.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD: The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.<DT>8 <DD>The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &quot;Here I am; you called me.&quot; Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.<DT>9 <DD>So Eli told Samuel, &quot;Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, `Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'&quot; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<DT>10 <DD>The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, &quot;Samuel! Samuel!&quot; Then Samuel said, &quot;Speak, for your servant is listening.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>And the LORD said to Samuel: &quot;See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.<DT>12 <DD>At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.<DT>13 <DD>For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_206813144_2">2</a>]</sup>   and he failed to restrain them.<DT>14 <DD>Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, `The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,<DT>16 <DD>but Eli called him and said, &quot;Samuel, my son.&quot; Samuel answered, &quot;Here I am.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>&quot;What was it he said to you?&quot; Eli asked. &quot;Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, &quot;He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.<DT>20 <DD>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.<DT>21 <DD>The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_206813144_1">[3] That is, tabernacle</A></LI>
