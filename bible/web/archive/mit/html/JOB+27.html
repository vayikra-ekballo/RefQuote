</DL><B>Job 27</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>And Job continued his discourse:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,<DT>3 <DD>as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,<DT>4 <DD>my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.<DT>5 <DD>I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.<DT>6 <DD>I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!<DT>8 <DD>For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?<DT>9 <DD>Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?<DT>10 <DD>Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? <DT>11 <DD>&quot;I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.<DT>12 <DD>You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk? <DT>13 <DD>&quot;Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:<DT>14 <DD>However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.<DT>15 <DD>The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.<DT>16 <DD>Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,<DT>17 <DD>what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.<DT>18 <DD>The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.<DT>19 <DD>He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.<DT>20 <DD>Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.<DT>21 <DD>The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.<DT>22 <DD>It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.<DT>23 <DD>It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place. </DL><OL></OL>
