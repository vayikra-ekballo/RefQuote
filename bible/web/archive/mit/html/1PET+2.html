</DL><B>1 Peter 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.<DT>2 <DD>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,<DT>3 <DD>now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.<DT>4 <DD>As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him--<DT>5 <DD>you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.<DT>6 <DD>For in Scripture it says: &quot;See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, &quot;The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>and, &quot;A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_4">4</a>]</sup>   They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for.<DT>9 <DD>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.<DT>10 <DD>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.<DT>11 <DD>Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.<DT>12 <DD>Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.<DT>13 <DD>Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority,<DT>14 <DD>or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.<DT>15 <DD>For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.<DT>16 <DD>Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.<DT>17 <DD>Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.<DT>18 <DD>Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.<DT>19 <DD>For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.<DT>20 <DD>But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.<DT>21 <DD>To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.<DT>22 <DD>&quot;He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>23 <DD>When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.<DT>24 <DD>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.<DT>25 <DD>For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_207350703_1">[6] Isaiah 28:16</A></LI>
