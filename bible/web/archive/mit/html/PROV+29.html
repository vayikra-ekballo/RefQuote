</DL><B>Proverbs 29</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy. <DT>2 <DD>When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan. <DT>3 <DD>A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. <DT>4 <DD>By justice a king gives a country stability, but one who is greedy for bribes tears it down. <DT>5 <DD>Whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet. <DT>6 <DD>An evil man is snared by his own sin, but a righteous one can sing and be glad. <DT>7 <DD>The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern. <DT>8 <DD>Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger. <DT>9 <DD>If a wise man goes to court with a fool, the fool rages and scoffs, and there is no peace. <DT>10 <DD>Bloodthirsty men hate a man of integrity and seek to kill the upright. <DT>11 <DD>A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control. <DT>12 <DD>If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked. <DT>13 <DD>The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives sight to the eyes of both. <DT>14 <DD>If a king judges the poor with fairness, his throne will always be secure. <DT>15 <DD>The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother. <DT>16 <DD>When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall. <DT>17 <DD>Discipline your son, and he will give you peace; he will bring delight to your soul. <DT>18 <DD>Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law. <DT>19 <DD>A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though he understands, he will not respond. <DT>20 <DD>Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him. <DT>21 <DD>If a man pampers his servant from youth, he will bring grief <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_1">1</a>]</sup>   in the end. <DT>22 <DD>An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered one commits many sins. <DT>23 <DD>A man's pride brings him low, but a man of lowly spirit gains honor. <DT>24 <DD>The accomplice of a thief is his own enemy; he is put under oath and dare not testify. <DT>25 <DD>Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is kept safe. <DT>26 <DD>Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the LORD that man gets justice. <DT>27 <DD>The righteous detest the dishonest; the wicked detest the upright.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_587762005_1">[21] The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
