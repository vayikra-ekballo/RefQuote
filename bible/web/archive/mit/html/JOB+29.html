</DL><B>Job 29</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Job continued his discourse:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,<DT>3 <DD>when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!<DT>4 <DD>Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,<DT>5 <DD>when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,<DT>6 <DD>when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,<DT>8 <DD>the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;<DT>9 <DD>the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;<DT>10 <DD>the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.<DT>11 <DD>Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,<DT>12 <DD>because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.<DT>13 <DD>The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.<DT>14 <DD>I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.<DT>15 <DD>I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.<DT>16 <DD>I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.<DT>17 <DD>I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;I thought, `I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.<DT>19 <DD>My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.<DT>20 <DD>My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.' <DT>21 <DD>&quot;Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.<DT>22 <DD>After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.<DT>23 <DD>They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.<DT>24 <DD>When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>25 <DD>I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_256396507_1">[24] The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain.</A></LI>
