</DL><B>Psalm 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 10  <sup>[<a href="#footnote_987156576_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>1 <DD>Why, O LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? <DT>2 <DD>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.<DT>3 <DD>He boasts of the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.<DT>4 <DD>In his pride the wicked does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.<DT>5 <DD>His ways are always prosperous; he is haughty and your laws are far from him; he sneers at all his enemies.<DT>6 <DD>He says to himself, &quot;Nothing will shake me; I'll always be happy and never have trouble.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>His mouth is full of curses and lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.<DT>8 <DD>He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent, watching in secret for his victims.<DT>9 <DD>He lies in wait like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.<DT>10 <DD>His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.<DT>11 <DD>He says to himself, &quot;God has forgotten; he covers his face and never sees.&quot; <DT>12 <DD>Arise, LORD! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.<DT>13 <DD>Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, &quot;He won't call me to account&quot;?<DT>14 <DD>But you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.<DT>15 <DD>Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out. <DT>16 <DD>The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.<DT>17 <DD>You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,<DT>18 <DD>defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_987156576_1">Psalms 9 and 10 may have been originally a single acrostic poem, the stanzas of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
