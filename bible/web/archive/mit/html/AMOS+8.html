</DL><B>Amos 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.<DT>2 <DD>&quot;What do you see, Amos?&quot; he asked. &quot;A basket of ripe fruit,&quot; I answered. Then the LORD said to me, &quot;The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.<DT>3 <DD>&quot;In that day,&quot; declares the Sovereign LORD, &quot;the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup>   Many, many bodies--flung everywhere! Silence!&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,<DT>5 <DD>saying, &quot;When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?&quot;-- skimping the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,<DT>6 <DD>buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat.<DT>7 <DD>The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: &quot;I will never forget anything they have done.<DT>8 <DD>&quot;Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;In that day,&quot; declares the Sovereign LORD, &quot;I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.<DT>10 <DD>I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;The days are coming,&quot; declares the Sovereign LORD, &quot;when I will send a famine through the land-- not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.<DT>12 <DD>Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;In that day &quot;the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.<DT>14 <DD>They who swear by the shame <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup>   of Samaria, or say, `As surely as your god lives, O Dan,' or, `As surely as the god <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_3">3</a>]</sup>   of Beersheba lives'-- they will fall, never to rise again.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_214350430_1">[3] Or <I>"the temple singers will wail</I></A></LI>
