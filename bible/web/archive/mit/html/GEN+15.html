</DL><B>Genesis 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: &quot;Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup>   your very great reward. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>2 <DD>But Abram said, &quot;O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup>   my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?&quot;<DT>3 <DD>And Abram said, &quot;You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to him: &quot;This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>He took him outside and said, &quot;Look up at the heavens and count the stars--if indeed you can count them.&quot; Then he said to him, &quot;So shall your offspring be.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.<DT>7 <DD>He also said to him, &quot;I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>But Abram said, &quot;O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>So the LORD said to him, &quot;Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.<DT>11 <DD>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.<DT>12 <DD>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.<DT>13 <DD>Then the LORD said to him, &quot;Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.<DT>14 <DD>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.<DT>15 <DD>You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.<DT>16 <DD>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.<DT>18 <DD>On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, &quot;To your descendants I give this land, from the river <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_4">4</a>]</sup>   of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates--<DT>19 <DD>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,<DT>20 <DD>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,<DT>21 <DD>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161036874_1">[1] Or <I>sovereign</I></A></LI>
