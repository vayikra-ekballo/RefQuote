</DL><B>Job 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.<DT>3 <DD>Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?<DT>4 <DD>When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.<DT>5 <DD>But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,<DT>6 <DD>if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.<DT>7 <DD>Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,<DT>9 <DD>for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.<DT>10 <DD>Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?<DT>11 <DD>Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?<DT>12 <DD>While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.<DT>13 <DD>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.<DT>14 <DD>What he trusts in is fragile <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; what he relies on is a spider's web.<DT>15 <DD>He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.<DT>16 <DD>He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;<DT>17 <DD>it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.<DT>18 <DD>But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, `I never saw you.'<DT>19 <DD>Surely its life withers away, and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_2">2</a>]</sup>   from the soil other plants grow. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.<DT>21 <DD>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.<DT>22 <DD>Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_127918997_1">[14] The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
