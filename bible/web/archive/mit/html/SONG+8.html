</DL><B>Song of Solomon 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.<DT>2 <DD>I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house-- she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.<DT>3 <DD>His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.<DT>4 <DD>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.<DT>5 <DD>Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.<DT>6 <DD>Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_1">1</a>]</sup>   unyielding as the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_2">2</a>]</sup>   It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_4">4</a>]</sup>   would be utterly scorned.<DT>8 <DD>We have a young sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?<DT>9 <DD>If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.<DT>10 <DD>I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.<DT>11 <DD>Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_5">5</a>]</sup>   of silver.<DT>12 <DD>But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred <sup>[<a href="#footnote_22445779_6">6</a>]</sup>   are for those who tend its fruit.<DT>13 <DD>You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!<DT>14 <DD>Come away, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_22445779_1">[6] Or <I>ardor</I></A></LI>
