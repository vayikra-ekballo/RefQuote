</DL><B>Micah 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave.<DT>2 <DD>The godly have been swept from the land; not one upright man remains. All men lie in wait to shed blood; each hunts his brother with a net.<DT>3 <DD>Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire-- they all conspire together.<DT>4 <DD>The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come, the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion.<DT>5 <DD>Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words.<DT>6 <DD>For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law-- a man's enemies are the members of his own household. <DT>7 <DD>But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me. <DT>8 <DD>Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.<DT>9 <DD>Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD's wrath, until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness.<DT>10 <DD>Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, &quot;Where is the LORD your God?&quot; My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets. <DT>11 <DD>The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries.<DT>12 <DD>In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.<DT>13 <DD>The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds. <DT>14 <DD>Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_270790527_1">1</a>]</sup>   Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders.&quot; <DT>16 <DD>Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will lay their hands on their mouths and their ears will become deaf.<DT>17 <DD>They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you.<DT>18 <DD>Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy.<DT>19 <DD>You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.<DT>20 <DD>You will be true to Jacob, and show mercy to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our fathers in days long ago.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_270790527_1">[14] Or <I>in the middle of Carmel</I></A></LI>
