</DL><B>Amos 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king's share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up.<DT>2 <DD>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, &quot;Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!&quot;<DT>3 <DD>So the LORD relented. &quot;This will not happen,&quot; the LORD said.<DT>4 <DD>This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.<DT>5 <DD>Then I cried out, &quot;Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!&quot;<DT>6 <DD>So the LORD relented. &quot;This will not happen either,&quot; the Sovereign LORD said.<DT>7 <DD>This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand.<DT>8 <DD>And the LORD asked me, &quot;What do you see, Amos?&quot; &quot;A plumb line,&quot; I replied. Then the Lord said, &quot;Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: &quot;Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.<DT>11 <DD>For this is what Amos is saying: &quot;`Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Then Amaziah said to Amos, &quot;Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.<DT>13 <DD>Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king's sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Amos answered Amaziah, &quot;I was neither a prophet nor a prophet's son, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees.<DT>15 <DD>But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, `Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'<DT>16 <DD>Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, &quot;`Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the house of Isaac.'<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Therefore this is what the LORD says: &quot;`Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup>   country. And Israel will certainly go into exile, away from their native land.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305023583_1">[17] Hebrew <I>an unclean</I></A></LI>
