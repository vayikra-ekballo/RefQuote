</DL><B>Matthew 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.<DT>3 <DD>He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'<DT>5 <DD>&quot;But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business.<DT>6 <DD>The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.<DT>7 <DD>The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.<DT>8 <DD>&quot;Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.<DT>9 <DD>Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.'<DT>10 <DD>So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.<DT>12 <DD>`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'<DT>14 <DD>&quot;For many are invited, but few are chosen.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.<DT>16 <DD>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. &quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.<DT>17 <DD>Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&quot;<DT>18 <DD>But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, &quot;You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?<DT>19 <DD>Show me the coin used for paying the tax.&quot; They brought him a denarius,<DT>20 <DD>and he asked them, &quot;Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?&quot;<DT>21 <DD>&quot;Caesar's,&quot; they replied. Then he said to them, &quot;Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.<DT>23 <DD>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.<DT>25 <DD>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.<DT>26 <DD>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.<DT>27 <DD>Finally, the woman died.<DT>28 <DD>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?&quot;<DT>29 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.<DT>30 <DD>At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.<DT>31 <DD>But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you,<DT>32 <DD>`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_1">1</a>]</sup>  ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.<DT>34 <DD>Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.<DT>35 <DD>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:<DT>36 <DD>&quot;Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?&quot;<DT>37 <DD>Jesus replied: &quot;`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>38 <DD>This is the first and greatest commandment.<DT>39 <DD>And the second is like it: `Love your neighbor as yourself.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>40 <DD>All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.&quot;<DT>41 <DD>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,<DT>42 <DD>&quot;What do you think about the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_4">4</a>]</sup>  ? Whose son is he?&quot; &quot;The son of David,&quot; they replied.<DT>43 <DD>He said to them, &quot;How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him `Lord'? For he says,<DT>44 <DD>&quot;`The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.&quot;' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_143354100_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>45 <DD>If then David calls him `Lord,' how can he be his son?&quot;<DT>46 <DD>No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_143354100_1">[32] Exodus 3:6</A></LI>
