</DL><B>Job 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!<DT>3 <DD>But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things? <DT>4 <DD>&quot;I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered-- a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!<DT>5 <DD>Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.<DT>6 <DD>The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure-- those who carry their god in their hands. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68325204_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>7 <DD>&quot;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;<DT>8 <DD>or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.<DT>9 <DD>Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?<DT>10 <DD>In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.<DT>11 <DD>Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?<DT>12 <DD>Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding? <DT>13 <DD>&quot;To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.<DT>14 <DD>What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.<DT>15 <DD>If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.<DT>16 <DD>To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.<DT>17 <DD>He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.<DT>18 <DD>He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68325204_2">2</a>]</sup>   around their waist.<DT>19 <DD>He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.<DT>20 <DD>He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.<DT>21 <DD>He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.<DT>22 <DD>He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.<DT>23 <DD>He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.<DT>24 <DD>He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.<DT>25 <DD>They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_68325204_1">[6] Or <I>secure  in what God's hand brings them</I></A></LI>
