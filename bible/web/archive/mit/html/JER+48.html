</DL><B>Jeremiah 48</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Concerning Moab:  This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &quot;Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_1">1</a>]</sup>   will be disgraced and shattered.<DT>2 <DD>Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_2">2</a>]</sup>   men will plot her downfall: `Come, let us put an end to that nation.' You too, O Madmen, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_3">3</a>]</sup>   will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.<DT>3 <DD>Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction.<DT>4 <DD>Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>They go up the way to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.<DT>6 <DD>Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_5">5</a>]</sup>   in the desert.<DT>7 <DD>Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.<DT>8 <DD>The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the LORD has spoken.<DT>9 <DD>Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_6">6</a>]</sup>  ; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;A curse on him who is lax in doing the LORD's work! A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed! <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another-- she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged.<DT>12 <DD>But days are coming,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;when I will send men who pour from jars, and they will pour her out; they will empty her jars and smash her jugs.<DT>13 <DD>Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;How can you say, `We are warriors, men valiant in battle'?<DT>15 <DD>Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,&quot; declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.<DT>16 <DD>&quot;The fall of Moab is at hand; her calamity will come quickly.<DT>17 <DD>Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, `How broken is the mighty scepter, how broken the glorious staff!' <DT>18 <DD>&quot;Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon, for he who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.<DT>19 <DD>Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ask them, `What has happened?'<DT>20 <DD>Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.<DT>21 <DD>Judgment has come to the plateau-- to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,<DT>22 <DD>to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,<DT>23 <DD>to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,<DT>24 <DD>to Kerioth and Bozrah-- to all the towns of Moab, far and near.<DT>25 <DD>Moab's horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_7">7</a>]</sup>   is cut off; her arm is broken,&quot;  declares the LORD. <DT>26 <DD>&quot;Make her drunk, for she has defied the LORD. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her be an object of ridicule.<DT>27 <DD>Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?<DT>28 <DD>Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave. <DT>29 <DD>&quot;We have heard of Moab's pride-- her overweening pride and conceit, her pride and arrogance and the haughtiness of her heart.<DT>30 <DD>I know her insolence but it is futile,&quot;  declares the LORD, &quot;and her boasts accomplish nothing.<DT>31 <DD>Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth.<DT>32 <DD>I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, O vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea; they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.<DT>33 <DD>Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy. <DT>34 <DD>&quot;The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.<DT>35 <DD>In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>36 <DD>&quot;So my heart laments for Moab like a flute; it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.<DT>37 <DD>Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth.<DT>38 <DD>On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>39 <DD>&quot;How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, an object of horror to all those around her.&quot;<DT>40 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.<DT>41 <DD>Kerioth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_8">8</a>]</sup>   will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.<DT>42 <DD>Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the LORD.<DT>43 <DD>Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of Moab,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>44 <DD>&quot;Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring upon Moab the year of her punishment,&quot;  declares the LORD. <DT>45 <DD>&quot;In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.<DT>46 <DD>Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity. <DT>47 <DD>&quot;Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come,&quot;  declares the LORD. Here ends the judgment on Moab. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_174670748_1">[1] Or <I>/ Misgab</I></A></LI>
