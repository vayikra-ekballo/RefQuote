</DL><B>Job 26</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!<DT>3 <DD>What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!<DT>4 <DD>Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth? <DT>5 <DD>&quot;The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.<DT>6 <DD>Death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup>   is naked before God; Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_2">2</a>]</sup>   lies uncovered.<DT>7 <DD>He spreads out the northern [skies] over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.<DT>8 <DD>He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.<DT>9 <DD>He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.<DT>10 <DD>He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.<DT>11 <DD>The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.<DT>12 <DD>By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.<DT>13 <DD>By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.<DT>14 <DD>And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_117192532_1">[6] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
