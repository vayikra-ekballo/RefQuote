</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.<DT>2 <DD>It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart.<DT>3 <DD>Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.<DT>4 <DD>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.<DT>5 <DD>It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.<DT>6 <DD>Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless. <DT>7 <DD>Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. <DT>8 <DD>The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.<DT>9 <DD>Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools. <DT>10 <DD>Do not say, &quot;Why were the old days better than these?&quot; For it is not wise to ask such questions. <DT>11 <DD>Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.<DT>12 <DD>Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.<DT>13 <DD>Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked?<DT>14 <DD>When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.<DT>15 <DD>In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.<DT>16 <DD>Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise-- why destroy yourself?<DT>17 <DD>Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool-- why die before your time?<DT>18 <DD>It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all [extremes]. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>19 <DD>Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city. <DT>20 <DD>There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins. <DT>21 <DD>Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you--<DT>22 <DD>for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.<DT>23 <DD>All this I tested by wisdom and I said, &quot;I am determined to be wise&quot;-- but this was beyond me.<DT>24 <DD>Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound-- who can discover it?<DT>25 <DD>So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly. <DT>26 <DD>I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.<DT>27 <DD>&quot;Look,&quot; says the Teacher, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_2">2</a>]</sup>   &quot;this is what I have discovered: &quot;Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things--<DT>28 <DD>while I was still searching but not finding-- I found one [upright] man among a thousand, but not one [upright] woman among them all.<DT>29 <DD>This only have I found: God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_107536116_1">[18] Or <I>will follow them both</I></A></LI>
