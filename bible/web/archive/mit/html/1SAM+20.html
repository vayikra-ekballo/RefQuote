</DL><B>1 Samuel 20</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, &quot;What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?&quot;<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Never!&quot; Jonathan replied. &quot;You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!&quot;<DT>3 <DD>But David took an oath and said, &quot;Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, `Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Jonathan said to David, &quot;Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>So David said, &quot;Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.<DT>6 <DD>If your father misses me at all, tell him, `David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'<DT>7 <DD>If he says, `Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.<DT>8 <DD>As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Never!&quot; Jonathan said. &quot;If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?&quot;<DT>10 <DD>David asked, &quot;Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Come,&quot; Jonathan said, &quot;let's go out into the field.&quot; So they went there together.<DT>12 <DD>Then Jonathan said to David: &quot;By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?<DT>13 <DD>But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.<DT>14 <DD>But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,<DT>15 <DD>and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, &quot;May the LORD call David's enemies to account.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.<DT>18 <DD>Then Jonathan said to David: &quot;Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.<DT>19 <DD>The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.<DT>20 <DD>I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.<DT>21 <DD>Then I will send a boy and say, `Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.<DT>22 <DD>But if I say to the boy, `Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.<DT>23 <DD>And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.<DT>25 <DD>He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107654525_1">1</a>]</sup>   and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.<DT>26 <DD>Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, &quot;Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, &quot;Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Jonathan answered, &quot;David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.<DT>29 <DD>He said, `Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, &quot;You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?<DT>31 <DD>As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!&quot;<DT>32 <DD>&quot;Why should he be put to death? What has he done?&quot; Jonathan asked his father.<DT>33 <DD>But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.<DT>34 <DD>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.<DT>35 <DD>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,<DT>36 <DD>and he said to the boy, &quot;Run and find the arrows I shoot.&quot; As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.<DT>37 <DD>When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, &quot;Isn't the arrow beyond you?&quot;<DT>38 <DD>Then he shouted, &quot;Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!&quot; The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.<DT>39 <DD>(The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)<DT>40 <DD>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, &quot;Go, carry them back to town.&quot;<DT>41 <DD>After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side [of the stone] and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.<DT>42 <DD>Jonathan said to David, &quot;Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, `The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'&quot; Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_107654525_1">[25] Septuagint; Hebrew <I>wall.
