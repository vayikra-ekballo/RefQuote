</DL><B>Proverbs 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. <DT>2 <DD>Rich and poor have this in common: The LORD is the Maker of them all. <DT>3 <DD>A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it. <DT>4 <DD>Humility and the fear of the LORD bring wealth and honor and life. <DT>5 <DD>In the paths of the wicked lie thorns and snares, but he who guards his soul stays far from them. <DT>6 <DD>Train <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162812305_1">1</a>]</sup>   a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it. <DT>7 <DD>The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. <DT>8 <DD>He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. <DT>9 <DD>A generous man will himself be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor. <DT>10 <DD>Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended. <DT>11 <DD>He who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious will have the king for his friend. <DT>12 <DD>The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. <DT>13 <DD>The sluggard says, &quot;There is a lion outside!&quot; or, &quot;I will be murdered in the streets!&quot; <DT>14 <DD>The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the LORD's wrath will fall into it. <DT>15 <DD>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. <DT>16 <DD>He who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich--both come to poverty. <DT>17 <DD>Pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise; apply your heart to what I teach,<DT>18 <DD>for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips.<DT>19 <DD>So that your trust may be in the LORD, I teach you today, even you.<DT>20 <DD>Have I not written thirty <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162812305_2">2</a>]</sup>   sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge,<DT>21 <DD>teaching you true and reliable words, so that you can give sound answers to him who sent you? <DT>22 <DD>Do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court,<DT>23 <DD>for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who plunder them. <DT>24 <DD>Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered,<DT>25 <DD>or you may learn his ways and get yourself ensnared. <DT>26 <DD>Do not be a man who strikes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts;<DT>27 <DD>if you lack the means to pay, your very bed will be snatched from under you. <DT>28 <DD>Do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your forefathers. <DT>29 <DD>Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_162812305_1">[6] Or <I>Start</I></A></LI>
