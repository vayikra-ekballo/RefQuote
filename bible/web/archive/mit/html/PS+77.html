</DL><B>Psalm 77</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 77  For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.<DT>2 <DD>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted. <DT>3 <DD>I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah<DT>4 <DD>You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.<DT>5 <DD>I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;<DT>6 <DD>I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired: <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?<DT>8 <DD>Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?<DT>9 <DD>Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?&quot; Selah <DT>10 <DD>Then I thought, &quot;To this I will appeal: the years of the right hand of the Most High.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.<DT>12 <DD>I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds. <DT>13 <DD>Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?<DT>14 <DD>You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.<DT>15 <DD>With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah <DT>16 <DD>The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.<DT>17 <DD>The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.<DT>18 <DD>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.<DT>19 <DD>Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen. <DT>20 <DD>You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. </DL><OL></OL>
