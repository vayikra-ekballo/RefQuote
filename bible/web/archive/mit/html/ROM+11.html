</DL><B>Romans 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.<DT>2 <DD>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:<DT>3 <DD>&quot;Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>4 <DD>And what was God's answer to him? &quot;I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.<DT>6 <DD>And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,<DT>8 <DD>as it is written: &quot;God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>And David says: &quot;May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.<DT>10 <DD>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>11 <DD>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.<DT>12 <DD>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!<DT>13 <DD>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry<DT>14 <DD>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.<DT>15 <DD>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?<DT>16 <DD>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.<DT>17 <DD>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,<DT>18 <DD>do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.<DT>19 <DD>You will say then, &quot;Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.<DT>21 <DD>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.<DT>22 <DD>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.<DT>23 <DD>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.<DT>24 <DD>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!<DT>25 <DD>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.<DT>26 <DD>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: &quot;The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.<DT>27 <DD>And this is <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_6">6</a>]</sup>   my covenant with them when I take away their sins.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_7">7</a>]</sup>  <DT>28 <DD>As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,<DT>29 <DD>for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.<DT>30 <DD>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,<DT>31 <DD>so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_8">8</a>]</sup>   receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.<DT>32 <DD>For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.<DT>33 <DD>Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_9">9</a>]</sup>   knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!<DT>34 <DD>&quot;Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_10">10</a>]</sup>  <DT>35 <DD>&quot;Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_11">11</a>]</sup>  <DT>36 <DD>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102876638_1">[3] 1 Kings 19:10,14</A></LI>
