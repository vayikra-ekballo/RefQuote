</DL><B>Luke 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,<DT>2 <DD>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.<DT>3 <DD>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.<DT>4 <DD>And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.<DT>5 <DD>They were delighted and agreed to give him money.<DT>6 <DD>He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.<DT>7 <DD>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.<DT>8 <DD>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, &quot;Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Where do you want us to prepare for it?&quot; they asked.<DT>10 <DD>He replied, &quot;As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,<DT>11 <DD>and say to the owner of the house, `The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'<DT>12 <DD>He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.<DT>14 <DD>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.<DT>15 <DD>And he said to them, &quot;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.<DT>16 <DD>For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &quot;Take this and divide it among you.<DT>18 <DD>For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &quot;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.<DT>21 <DD>But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.<DT>22 <DD>The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.<DT>24 <DD>Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.<DT>25 <DD>Jesus said to them, &quot;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.<DT>26 <DD>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.<DT>27 <DD>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.<DT>28 <DD>You are those who have stood by me in my trials.<DT>29 <DD>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,<DT>30 <DD>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<DT>31 <DD>&quot;Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_1">1</a>]</sup>   as wheat.<DT>32 <DD>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>But he replied, &quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.&quot;<DT>34 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.&quot;<DT>35 <DD>Then Jesus asked them, &quot;When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot; they answered.<DT>36 <DD>He said to them, &quot;But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.<DT>37 <DD>It is written: `And he was numbered with the transgressors' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.&quot;<DT>38 <DD>The disciples said, &quot;See, Lord, here are two swords.&quot; &quot;That is enough,&quot; he replied.<DT>39 <DD>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.<DT>40 <DD>On reaching the place, he said to them, &quot;Pray that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;<DT>41 <DD>He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,<DT>42 <DD>&quot;Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.&quot;<DT>43 <DD>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.<DT>44 <DD>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>45 <DD>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.<DT>46 <DD>&quot;Why are you sleeping?&quot; he asked them. &quot;Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;<DT>47 <DD>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,<DT>48 <DD>but Jesus asked him, &quot;Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&quot;<DT>49 <DD>When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, &quot;Lord, should we strike with our swords?&quot;<DT>50 <DD>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.<DT>51 <DD>But Jesus answered, &quot;No more of this!&quot; And he touched the man's ear and healed him.<DT>52 <DD>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, &quot;Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?<DT>53 <DD>Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.&quot;<DT>54 <DD>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.<DT>55 <DD>But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.<DT>56 <DD>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, &quot;This man was with him.&quot;<DT>57 <DD>But he denied it. &quot;Woman, I don't know him,&quot; he said.<DT>58 <DD>A little later someone else saw him and said, &quot;You also are one of them.&quot; &quot;Man, I am not!&quot; Peter replied.<DT>59 <DD>About an hour later another asserted, &quot;Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.&quot;<DT>60 <DD>Peter replied, &quot;Man, I don't know what you're talking about!&quot; Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.<DT>61 <DD>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: &quot;Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.&quot;<DT>62 <DD>And he went outside and wept bitterly.<DT>63 <DD>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.<DT>64 <DD>They blindfolded him and demanded, &quot;Prophesy! Who hit you?&quot;<DT>65 <DD>And they said many other insulting things to him.<DT>66 <DD>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.<DT>67 <DD>&quot;If you are the Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_4">4</a>]</sup>  &quot; they said, &quot;tell us.&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;If I tell you, you will not believe me,<DT>68 <DD>and if I asked you, you would not answer.<DT>69 <DD>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.&quot;<DT>70 <DD>They all asked, &quot;Are you then the Son of God?&quot; He replied, &quot;You are right in saying I am.&quot;<DT>71 <DD>Then they said, &quot;Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_188265317_1">[31] The Greek is plural.</A></LI>
