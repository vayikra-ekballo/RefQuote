</DL><B>Isaiah 19</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An oracle concerning Egypt: See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them. <DT>2 <DD>&quot;I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian-- brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.<DT>3 <DD>The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.<DT>4 <DD>I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them,&quot; declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <DT>5 <DD>The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.<DT>6 <DD>The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither,<DT>7 <DD>also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.<DT>8 <DD>The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.<DT>9 <DD>Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.<DT>10 <DD>The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart. <DT>11 <DD>The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, &quot;I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings&quot;? <DT>12 <DD>Where are your wise men now? Let them show you and make known what the LORD Almighty has planned against Egypt.<DT>13 <DD>The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_1">1</a>]</sup>   are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray.<DT>14 <DD>The LORD has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.<DT>15 <DD>There is nothing Egypt can do-- head or tail, palm branch or reed.<DT>16 <DD>In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them.<DT>17 <DD>And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them.<DT>18 <DD>In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of Destruction. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>19 <DD>In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border.<DT>20 <DD>It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.<DT>21 <DD>So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them.<DT>22 <DD>The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.<DT>23 <DD>In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.<DT>24 <DD>In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.<DT>25 <DD>The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, &quot;Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161676293_1">[13] Hebrew <I>Noph</I></A></LI>
