</DL><B>Job 31</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.<DT>2 <DD>For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?<DT>3 <DD>Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?<DT>4 <DD>Does he not see my ways and count my every step? <DT>5 <DD>&quot;If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit--<DT>6 <DD>let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless--<DT>7 <DD>if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,<DT>8 <DD>then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,<DT>10 <DD>then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.<DT>11 <DD>For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.<DT>12 <DD>It is a fire that burns to Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; it would have uprooted my harvest. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,<DT>14 <DD>what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?<DT>15 <DD>Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? <DT>16 <DD>&quot;If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,<DT>17 <DD>if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless--<DT>18 <DD>but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow--<DT>19 <DD>if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,<DT>20 <DD>and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,<DT>21 <DD>if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,<DT>22 <DD>then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.<DT>23 <DD>For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things. <DT>24 <DD>&quot;If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, `You are my security,'<DT>25 <DD>if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,<DT>26 <DD>if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,<DT>27 <DD>so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,<DT>28 <DD>then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high. <DT>29 <DD>&quot;If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him--<DT>30 <DD>I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life--<DT>31 <DD>if the men of my household have never said, `Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'--<DT>32 <DD>but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler--<DT>33 <DD>if I have concealed my sin as men do, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_2">2</a>]</sup>   by hiding my guilt in my heart<DT>34 <DD>because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside <DT>35 <DD>(&quot;Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.<DT>36 <DD>Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.<DT>37 <DD>I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)-- <DT>38 <DD>&quot;if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,<DT>39 <DD>if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,<DT>40 <DD>then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley.&quot;  The words of Job are ended. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_720658957_1">[12] Hebrew <I>Abaddon</I></A></LI>
