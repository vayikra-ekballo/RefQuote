Nun <DT>105 <DD>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.<DT>106 <DD>I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will follow your righteous laws.<DT>107 <DD>I have suffered much; preserve my life, O LORD, according to your word.<DT>108 <DD>Accept, O LORD, the willing praise of my mouth, and teach me your laws.<DT>109 <DD>Though I constantly take my life in my hands, I will not forget your law.<DT>110 <DD>The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.<DT>111 <DD>Your statutes are my heritage forever; they are the joy of my heart.<DT>112 <DD>My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.  Samekh <DT>113 <DD>I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.<DT>114 <DD>You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word.<DT>115 <DD>Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God!<DT>116 <DD>Sustain me according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.<DT>117 <DD>Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I will always have regard for your decrees.<DT>118 <DD>You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their deceitfulness is in vain.<DT>119 <DD>All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; therefore I love your statutes.<DT>120 <DD>My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws.  Ayin <DT>121 <DD>I have done what is righteous and just; do not leave me to my oppressors.<DT>122 <DD>Ensure your servant's well-being; let not the arrogant oppress me.<DT>123 <DD>My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise.<DT>124 <DD>Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees.<DT>125 <DD>I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes.<DT>126 <DD>It is time for you to act, O LORD; your law is being broken.<DT>127 <DD>Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold,<DT>128 <DD>and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path.  Pe <DT>129 <DD>Your statutes are wonderful; therefore I obey them.<DT>130 <DD>The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.<DT>131 <DD>I open my mouth and pant, longing for your commands.<DT>132 <DD>Turn to me and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name.<DT>133 <DD>Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.<DT>134 <DD>Redeem me from the oppression of men, that I may obey your precepts.<DT>135 <DD>Make your face shine upon your servant and teach me your decrees.<DT>136 <DD>Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed.  Tsadhe <DT>137 <DD>Righteous are you, O LORD, and your laws are right.<DT>138 <DD>The statutes you have laid down are righteous; they are fully trustworthy.<DT>139 <DD>My zeal wears me out, for my enemies ignore your words.<DT>140 <DD>Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them.<DT>141 <DD>Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts.<DT>142 <DD>Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true.<DT>143 <DD>Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands are my delight.<DT>144 <DD>Your statutes are forever right; give me understanding that I may live.  Qoph <DT>145 <DD>I call with all my heart; answer me, O LORD, and I will obey your decrees.<DT>146 <DD>I call out to you; save me and I will keep your statutes.<DT>147 <DD>I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word.<DT>148 <DD>My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises.<DT>149 <DD>Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, O LORD, according to your laws.<DT>150 <DD>Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law.<DT>151 <DD>Yet you are near, O LORD, and all your commands are true.<DT>152 <DD>Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever.  Resh <DT>153 <DD>Look upon my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law.<DT>154 <DD>Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise.<DT>155 <DD>Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees.<DT>156 <DD>Your compassion is great, O LORD; preserve my life according to your laws.<DT>157 <DD>Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes.<DT>158 <DD>I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word.<DT>159 <DD>See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, O LORD, according to your love.<DT>160 <DD>All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.  Sin and Shin <DT>161 <DD>Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word.<DT>162 <DD>I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil.<DT>163 <DD>I hate and abhor falsehood but I love your law.<DT>164 <DD>Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws.<DT>165 <DD>Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble.<DT>166 <DD>I wait for your salvation, O LORD, and I follow your commands.<DT>167 <DD>I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly.<DT>168 <DD>I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you.  Taw <DT>169 <DD>May my cry come before you, O LORD; give me understanding according to your word.<DT>170 <DD>May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise.<DT>171 <DD>May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees.<DT>172 <DD>May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous.<DT>173 <DD>May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.<DT>174 <DD>I long for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight.<DT>175 <DD>Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me.<DT>176 <DD>I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I have not forgotten your commands. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_53237526_1">This psalm is an acrostic poem; the verses of each stanza begin with the same letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</A></LI>
