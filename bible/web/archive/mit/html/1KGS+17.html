</DL><B>1 Kings 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_878711724_1">1</a>]</sup>   in Gilead, said to Ahab, &quot;As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah:<DT>3 <DD>&quot;Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.<DT>4 <DD>You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>So he did what the LORD had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.<DT>6 <DD>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.<DT>7 <DD>Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.<DT>8 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to him:<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, &quot;Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>As she was going to get it, he called, &quot;And bring me, please, a piece of bread.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>&quot;As surely as the LORD your God lives,&quot; she replied, &quot;I don't have any bread--only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it--and die.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Elijah said to her, &quot;Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.<DT>14 <DD>For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives rain on the land.'&quot;<DT>15 <DD>She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.<DT>16 <DD>For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.<DT>17 <DD>Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.<DT>18 <DD>She said to Elijah, &quot;What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?&quot;<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Give me your son,&quot; Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.<DT>20 <DD>Then he cried out to the LORD, &quot;O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?&quot;<DT>21 <DD>Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the LORD, &quot;O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!&quot;<DT>22 <DD>The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.<DT>23 <DD>Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, &quot;Look, your son is alive!&quot;<DT>24 <DD>Then the woman said to Elijah, &quot;Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_878711724_1">[1] Or <I>Tishbite, of the settlers</I></A></LI>
