</DL><B>Proverbs 18</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An unfriendly man pursues selfish ends; he defies all sound judgment. <DT>2 <DD>A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions. <DT>3 <DD>When wickedness comes, so does contempt, and with shame comes disgrace. <DT>4 <DD>The words of a man's mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. <DT>5 <DD>It is not good to be partial to the wicked or to deprive the innocent of justice. <DT>6 <DD>A fool's lips bring him strife, and his mouth invites a beating. <DT>7 <DD>A fool's mouth is his undoing, and his lips are a snare to his soul. <DT>8 <DD>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts. <DT>9 <DD>One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys. <DT>10 <DD>The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe. <DT>11 <DD>The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it an unscalable wall. <DT>12 <DD>Before his downfall a man's heart is proud, but humility comes before honor. <DT>13 <DD>He who answers before listening-- that is his folly and his shame. <DT>14 <DD>A man's spirit sustains him in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear? <DT>15 <DD>The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out. <DT>16 <DD>A gift opens the way for the giver and ushers him into the presence of the great. <DT>17 <DD>The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him. <DT>18 <DD>Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart. <DT>19 <DD>An offended brother is more unyielding than a fortified city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel. <DT>20 <DD>From the fruit of his mouth a man's stomach is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied. <DT>21 <DD>The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. <DT>22 <DD>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the LORD. <DT>23 <DD>A poor man pleads for mercy, but a rich man answers harshly. <DT>24 <DD>A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. </DL><OL></OL>
