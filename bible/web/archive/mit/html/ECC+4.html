</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed-- and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-- and they have no comforter.<DT>2 <DD>And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.<DT>3 <DD>But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.<DT>4 <DD>And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<DT>5 <DD>The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.<DT>6 <DD>Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.<DT>7 <DD>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:<DT>8 <DD>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. &quot;For whom am I toiling,&quot; he asked, &quot;and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?&quot; This too is meaningless-- a miserable business! <DT>9 <DD>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work:<DT>10 <DD>If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!<DT>11 <DD>Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?<DT>12 <DD>Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.<DT>13 <DD>Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.<DT>14 <DD>The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.<DT>15 <DD>I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.<DT>16 <DD>There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</DL><OL></OL>
