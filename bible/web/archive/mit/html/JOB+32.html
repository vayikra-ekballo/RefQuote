</DL><B>Job 32</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<DT>2 <DD>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.<DT>3 <DD>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.<DT>5 <DD>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.<DT>6 <DD>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: &quot;I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.<DT>7 <DD>I thought, `Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'<DT>8 <DD>But it is the spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_2">2</a>]</sup>   in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.<DT>9 <DD>It is not only the old <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_3">3</a>]</sup>   who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.<DT>11 <DD>I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,<DT>12 <DD>I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.<DT>13 <DD>Do not say, `We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'<DT>14 <DD>But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.<DT>16 <DD>Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?<DT>17 <DD>I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.<DT>18 <DD>For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;<DT>19 <DD>inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.<DT>20 <DD>I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.<DT>21 <DD>I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;<DT>22 <DD>for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_420022404_1">[3] Masoretic Text; an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition <I>Job, and so had condemned God</I></A></LI>
