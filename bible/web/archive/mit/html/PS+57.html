</DL><B>Psalm 57</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 57  For the director of music. [To the tune of] &quot;Do Not Destroy.&quot; Of David. A miktam. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup>   When he had fled from Saul into the cave.<DT>1 <DD>Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed. <DT>2 <DD>I cry out to God Most High, to God, who fulfills [his purpose] for me.<DT>3 <DD>He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me; Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness. <DT>4 <DD>I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts-- men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. <DT>5 <DD>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth. <DT>6 <DD>They spread a net for my feet-- I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path-- but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah <DT>7 <DD>My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.<DT>8 <DD>Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn. <DT>9 <DD>I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.<DT>10 <DD>For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies. <DT>11 <DD>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_172736232_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
