</DL><B>2 Timothy 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:<DT>2 <DD>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.<DT>3 <DD>For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.<DT>4 <DD>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.<DT>5 <DD>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.<DT>6 <DD>For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.<DT>7 <DD>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.<DT>8 <DD>Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.<DT>9 <DD>Do your best to come to me quickly,<DT>10 <DD>for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.<DT>11 <DD>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.<DT>12 <DD>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.<DT>13 <DD>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.<DT>14 <DD>Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.<DT>15 <DD>You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.<DT>16 <DD>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.<DT>17 <DD>But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.<DT>18 <DD>The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <DT>19 <DD>Greet Priscilla <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_1">1</a>]</sup>   and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.<DT>20 <DD>Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.<DT>21 <DD>Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.<DT>22 <DD>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_854534052_1">[19] Greek <I>Prisca</I>, a variant of <I>Priscilla</I></A></LI>
