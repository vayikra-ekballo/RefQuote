</DL><B>Matthew 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea<DT>2 <DD>and saying, &quot;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: &quot;A voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.<DT>5 <DD>People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.<DT>6 <DD>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.<DT>7 <DD>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: &quot;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?<DT>8 <DD>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.<DT>9 <DD>And do not think you can say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.<DT>10 <DD>The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_2">2</a>]</sup>   water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.<DT>12 <DD>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.<DT>14 <DD>But John tried to deter him, saying, &quot;I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.&quot; Then John consented.<DT>16 <DD>As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.<DT>17 <DD>And a voice from heaven said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_184292258_1">[3] Isaiah 40:3</A></LI>
