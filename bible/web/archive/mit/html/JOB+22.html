</DL><B>Job 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?<DT>3 <DD>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless? <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?<DT>5 <DD>Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?<DT>6 <DD>You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.<DT>7 <DD>You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,<DT>8 <DD>though you were a powerful man, owning land-- an honored man, living on it.<DT>9 <DD>And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.<DT>10 <DD>That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,<DT>11 <DD>why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!<DT>13 <DD>Yet you say, `What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?<DT>14 <DD>Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'<DT>15 <DD>Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?<DT>16 <DD>They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.<DT>17 <DD>They said to God, `Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'<DT>18 <DD>Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked. <DT>19 <DD>&quot;The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,<DT>20 <DD>`Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.' <DT>21 <DD>&quot;Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.<DT>22 <DD>Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.<DT>23 <DD>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: If you remove wickedness far from your tent<DT>24 <DD>and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,<DT>25 <DD>then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.<DT>26 <DD>Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.<DT>27 <DD>You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.<DT>28 <DD>What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.<DT>29 <DD>When men are brought low and you say, `Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.<DT>30 <DD>He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
