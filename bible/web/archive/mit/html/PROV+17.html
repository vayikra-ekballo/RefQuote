</DL><B>Proverbs 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207843080_1">1</a>]</sup>   with strife. <DT>2 <DD>A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son, and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers. <DT>3 <DD>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tests the heart. <DT>4 <DD>A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar pays attention to a malicious tongue. <DT>5 <DD>He who mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker; whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished. <DT>6 <DD>Children's children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children. <DT>7 <DD>Arrogant <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207843080_2">2</a>]</sup>   lips are unsuited to a fool-- how much worse lying lips to a ruler! <DT>8 <DD>A bribe is a charm to the one who gives it; wherever he turns, he succeeds. <DT>9 <DD>He who covers over an offense promotes love, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends. <DT>10 <DD>A rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred lashes a fool. <DT>11 <DD>An evil man is bent only on rebellion; a merciless official will be sent against him. <DT>12 <DD>Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly. <DT>13 <DD>If a man pays back evil for good, evil will never leave his house. <DT>14 <DD>Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out. <DT>15 <DD>Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent-- the LORD detests them both. <DT>16 <DD>Of what use is money in the hand of a fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom? <DT>17 <DD>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. <DT>18 <DD>A man lacking in judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor. <DT>19 <DD>He who loves a quarrel loves sin; he who builds a high gate invites destruction. <DT>20 <DD>A man of perverse heart does not prosper; he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble. <DT>21 <DD>To have a fool for a son brings grief; there is no joy for the father of a fool. <DT>22 <DD>A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. <DT>23 <DD>A wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice. <DT>24 <DD>A discerning man keeps wisdom in view, but a fool's eyes wander to the ends of the earth. <DT>25 <DD>A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the one who bore him. <DT>26 <DD>It is not good to punish an innocent man, or to flog officials for their integrity. <DT>27 <DD>A man of knowledge uses words with restraint, and a man of understanding is even-tempered. <DT>28 <DD>Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_207843080_1">[1] Hebrew <I>sacrifices</I></A></LI>
