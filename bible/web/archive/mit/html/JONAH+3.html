</DL><B>Jonah 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important city--a visit required three days.<DT>4 <DD>On the first day, Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed: &quot;Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.<DT>6 <DD>When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.<DT>7 <DD>Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh:  &quot;By the decree of the king and his nobles:  Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.<DT>8 <DD>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.<DT>9 <DD>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.&quot; <DT>10 <DD>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.</DL><OL></OL>
