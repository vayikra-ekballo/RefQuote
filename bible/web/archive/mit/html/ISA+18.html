Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers. <DT>3 <DD>All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.<DT>4 <DD>This is what the LORD says to me: &quot;I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.<DT>6 <DD>They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.<DT>7 <DD>At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers-- the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD Almighty. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_192609660_1">[1] Or <I>of locusts</I></A></LI>
