</DL><B>Job 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?<DT>2 <DD>Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,<DT>3 <DD>so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.<DT>4 <DD>When I lie down I think, `How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.<DT>5 <DD>My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.<DT>7 <DD>Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.<DT>8 <DD>The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.<DT>9 <DD>As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup>   does not return.<DT>10 <DD>He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<DT>12 <DD>Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?<DT>13 <DD>When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,<DT>14 <DD>even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,<DT>15 <DD>so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.<DT>16 <DD>I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning. <DT>17 <DD>&quot;What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,<DT>18 <DD>that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?<DT>19 <DD>Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?<DT>20 <DD>If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>21 <DD>Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_158199311_1">[9] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
