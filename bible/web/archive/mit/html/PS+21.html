</DL><B>Psalm 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 21  For the director of music. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD, the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give!<DT>2 <DD>You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah<DT>3 <DD>You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.<DT>4 <DD>He asked you for life, and you gave it to him-- length of days, for ever and ever.<DT>5 <DD>Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.<DT>6 <DD>Surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.<DT>7 <DD>For the king trusts in the LORD; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken. <DT>8 <DD>Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.<DT>9 <DD>At the time of your appearing you will make them like a fiery furnace. In his wrath the LORD will swallow them up, and his fire will consume them.<DT>10 <DD>You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.<DT>11 <DD>Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed;<DT>12 <DD>for you will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow. <DT>13 <DD>Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength; we will sing and praise your might. </DL><OL></OL>
