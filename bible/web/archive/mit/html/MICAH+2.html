</DL><B>Micah 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.<DT>2 <DD>They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud a man of his home, a fellowman of his inheritance.<DT>3 <DD>Therefore, the LORD says: &quot;I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.<DT>4 <DD>In that day men will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: `We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'&quot; <DT>5 <DD>Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;Do not prophesy,&quot; their prophets say. &quot;Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>Should it be said, O house of Jacob: &quot;Is the Spirit of the LORD angry? Does he do such things?&quot;  &quot;Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright?<DT>8 <DD>Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.<DT>9 <DD>You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.<DT>10 <DD>Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.<DT>11 <DD>If a liar and deceiver comes and says, `I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' he would be just the prophet for this people! <DT>12 <DD>&quot;I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people.<DT>13 <DD>One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the LORD at their head.&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
