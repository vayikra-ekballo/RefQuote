</DL><B>1 Peter 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed:<DT>2 <DD>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;<DT>3 <DD>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.<DT>4 <DD>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.<DT>5 <DD>Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, &quot;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>6 <DD>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.<DT>7 <DD>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.<DT>8 <DD>Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.<DT>9 <DD>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.<DT>10 <DD>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.<DT>11 <DD>To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen. <DT>12 <DD>With the help of Silas, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_2">2</a>]</sup>   whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.<DT>13 <DD>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.<DT>14 <DD>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115556033_1">[5] Prov. 3:34</A></LI>
