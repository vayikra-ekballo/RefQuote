</DL><B>John 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.<DT>2 <DD>His disciples asked him, &quot;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&quot;<DT>3 <DD>&quot;Neither this man nor his parents sinned,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.<DT>4 <DD>As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.<DT>5 <DD>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Go,&quot; he told him, &quot;wash in the Pool of Siloam&quot; (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.<DT>8 <DD>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, &quot;Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Some claimed that he was. Others said, &quot;No, he only looks like him.&quot; But he himself insisted, &quot;I am the man.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>&quot;How then were your eyes opened?&quot; they demanded.<DT>11 <DD>He replied, &quot;The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>&quot;Where is this man?&quot; they asked him. &quot;I don't know,&quot; he said.<DT>13 <DD>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.<DT>14 <DD>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.<DT>15 <DD>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. &quot;He put mud on my eyes,&quot; the man replied, &quot;and I washed, and now I see.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>Some of the Pharisees said, &quot;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&quot; But others asked, &quot;How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?&quot; So they were divided.<DT>17 <DD>Finally they turned again to the blind man, &quot;What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.&quot; The man replied, &quot;He is a prophet.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Is this your son?&quot; they asked. &quot;Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?&quot;<DT>20 <DD>&quot;We know he is our son,&quot; the parents answered, &quot;and we know he was born blind.<DT>21 <DD>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup>   would be put out of the synagogue.<DT>23 <DD>That was why his parents said, &quot;He is of age; ask him.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. &quot;Give glory to God, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot; they said. &quot;We know this man is a sinner.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>He replied, &quot;Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!&quot;<DT>26 <DD>Then they asked him, &quot;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&quot;<DT>27 <DD>He answered, &quot;I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Then they hurled insults at him and said, &quot;You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!<DT>29 <DD>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>The man answered, &quot;Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.<DT>31 <DD>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.<DT>32 <DD>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.<DT>33 <DD>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&quot;<DT>34 <DD>To this they replied, &quot;You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!&quot; And they threw him out.<DT>35 <DD>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, &quot;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&quot;<DT>36 <DD>&quot;Who is he, sir?&quot; the man asked. &quot;Tell me so that I may believe in him.&quot;<DT>37 <DD>Jesus said, &quot;You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.&quot;<DT>38 <DD>Then the man said, &quot;Lord, I believe,&quot; and he worshiped him.<DT>39 <DD>Jesus said, &quot;For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.&quot;<DT>40 <DD>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, &quot;What? Are we blind too?&quot;<DT>41 <DD>Jesus said, &quot;If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_214350430_1">[22] Or <I>Messiah</I></A></LI>
