</DL><B>Philippians 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.<DT>2 <DD>Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.<DT>3 <DD>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--<DT>4 <DD>though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:<DT>5 <DD>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;<DT>6 <DD>as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.<DT>7 <DD>But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.<DT>8 <DD>What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ<DT>9 <DD>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.<DT>10 <DD>I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,<DT>11 <DD>and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.<DT>12 <DD>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.<DT>13 <DD>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,<DT>14 <DD>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.<DT>15 <DD>All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.<DT>16 <DD>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.<DT>17 <DD>Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.<DT>18 <DD>For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.<DT>19 <DD>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.<DT>20 <DD>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,<DT>21 <DD>who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.</DL><OL></OL>
