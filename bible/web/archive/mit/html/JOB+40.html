</DL><B>Job 40</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to Job:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then Job answered the LORD:<DT>4 <DD>&quot;I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.<DT>5 <DD>I spoke once, but I have no answer-- twice, but I will say no more.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm:<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?<DT>9 <DD>Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?<DT>10 <DD>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.<DT>11 <DD>Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,<DT>12 <DD>look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.<DT>13 <DD>Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.<DT>14 <DD>Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;Look at the behemoth, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_1">1</a>]</sup>   which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.<DT>16 <DD>What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!<DT>17 <DD>His tail <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_2">2</a>]</sup>   sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.<DT>18 <DD>His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.<DT>19 <DD>He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.<DT>20 <DD>The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.<DT>21 <DD>Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.<DT>22 <DD>The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.<DT>23 <DD>When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.<DT>24 <DD>Can anyone capture him by the eyes, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142540437_3">3</a>]</sup>   or trap him and pierce his nose? </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_142540437_1">[15] Possibly the hippopotamus or the elephant</A></LI>
