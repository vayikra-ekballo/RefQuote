</DL><B>Psalm 35</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 35  Of David.<DT>1 <DD>Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.<DT>2 <DD>Take up shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.<DT>3 <DD>Brandish spear and javelin <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_1">1</a>]</sup>   against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, &quot;I am your salvation.&quot; <DT>4 <DD>May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.<DT>5 <DD>May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;<DT>6 <DD>may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.<DT>7 <DD>Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,<DT>8 <DD>may ruin overtake them by surprise-- may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.<DT>9 <DD>Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.<DT>10 <DD>My whole being will exclaim, &quot;Who is like you, O LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.&quot; <DT>11 <DD>Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.<DT>12 <DD>They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.<DT>13 <DD>Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,<DT>14 <DD>I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.<DT>15 <DD>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.<DT>16 <DD>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892971719_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; they gnashed their teeth at me.<DT>17 <DD>O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.<DT>18 <DD>I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you. <DT>19 <DD>Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.<DT>20 <DD>They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.<DT>21 <DD>They gape at me and say, &quot;Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.&quot; <DT>22 <DD>O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.<DT>23 <DD>Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.<DT>24 <DD>Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.<DT>25 <DD>Do not let them think, &quot;Aha, just what we wanted!&quot; or say, &quot;We have swallowed him up.&quot; <DT>26 <DD>May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.<DT>27 <DD>May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, &quot;The LORD be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>My tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day long. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_892971719_1">[3] Or <I>and block the way</I></A></LI>
