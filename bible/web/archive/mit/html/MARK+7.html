</DL><B>Mark 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and<DT>2 <DD>saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were &quot;unclean,&quot; that is, unwashed.<DT>3 <DD>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.<DT>4 <DD>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_1">1</a>]</sup>  )<DT>5 <DD>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, &quot;Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with `unclean' hands?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>He replied, &quot;Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: &quot;`These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.<DT>7 <DD>They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>And he said to them: &quot;You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_3">3</a>]</sup>   your own traditions!<DT>10 <DD>For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother,' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_4">4</a>]</sup>   and, `Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>11 <DD>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: `Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),<DT>12 <DD>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.<DT>13 <DD>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, &quot;Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.<DT>15 <DD>Nothing outside a man can make him `unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him `unclean.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_6">6</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>17 <DD>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.<DT>18 <DD>&quot;Are you so dull?&quot; he asked. &quot;Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him `unclean'?<DT>19 <DD>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.&quot; (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods &quot;clean.&quot;)<DT>20 <DD>He went on: &quot;What comes out of a man is what makes him `unclean.'<DT>21 <DD>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,<DT>22 <DD>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.<DT>23 <DD>All these evils come from inside and make a man `unclean.'&quot;<DT>24 <DD>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_7">7</a>]</sup>   He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.<DT>25 <DD>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_8">8</a>]</sup>   spirit came and fell at his feet.<DT>26 <DD>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.<DT>27 <DD>&quot;First let the children eat all they want,&quot; he told her, &quot;for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; she replied, &quot;but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.&quot;<DT>29 <DD>Then he told her, &quot;For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.<DT>31 <DD>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_9">9</a>]</sup>  <DT>32 <DD>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.<DT>33 <DD>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.<DT>34 <DD>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, &quot;Ephphatha!&quot; (which means, &quot;Be opened!&quot;).<DT>35 <DD>At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.<DT>36 <DD>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.<DT>37 <DD>People were overwhelmed with amazement. &quot;He has done everything well,&quot; they said. &quot;He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_181955953_1">[4] Some early manuscripts <I>pitchers, kettles and dining couches</I></A></LI>
