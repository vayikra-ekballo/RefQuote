</DL><B>Ezekiel 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`In the pride of your heart you say, &quot;I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.&quot; But you are a man and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.<DT>3 <DD>Are you wiser than Daniel <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_1">1</a>]</sup>  ? Is no secret hidden from you?<DT>4 <DD>By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.<DT>5 <DD>By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;`Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`Because you think you are wise, as wise as a god,<DT>7 <DD>I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations; they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor.<DT>8 <DD>They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.<DT>9 <DD>Will you then say, &quot;I am a god,&quot; in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a man, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you.<DT>10 <DD>You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.'&quot; <DT>11 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>12 <DD>&quot;Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.<DT>13 <DD>You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper, sapphire, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_2">2</a>]</sup>   turquoise and beryl. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_3">3</a>]</sup>   Your settings and mountings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_665498764_4">4</a>]</sup>   were made of gold; on the day you were created they were prepared.<DT>14 <DD>You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones.<DT>15 <DD>You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.<DT>16 <DD>Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.<DT>17 <DD>Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.<DT>18 <DD>By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.<DT>19 <DD>All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.'&quot;<DT>20 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>21 <DD>&quot;Son of man, set your face against Sidon; prophesy against her<DT>22 <DD>and say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`I am against you, O Sidon, and I will gain glory within you. They will know that I am the LORD, when I inflict punishment on her and show myself holy within her.<DT>23 <DD>I will send a plague upon her and make blood flow in her streets. The slain will fall within her, with the sword against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;`No longer will the people of Israel have malicious neighbors who are painful briers and sharp thorns. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;`This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I gather the people of Israel from the nations where they have been scattered, I will show myself holy among them in the sight of the nations. Then they will live in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.<DT>26 <DD>They will live there in safety and will build houses and plant vineyards; they will live in safety when I inflict punishment on all their neighbors who maligned them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_665498764_1">[3] Or <I>Danel</I>; the Hebrew spelling may suggest a person other than the prophet Daniel.</A></LI>
