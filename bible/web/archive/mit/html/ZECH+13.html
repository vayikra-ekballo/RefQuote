</DL><B>Zechariah 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.<DT>2 <DD>&quot;On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,&quot; declares the LORD Almighty. &quot;I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.<DT>3 <DD>And if anyone still prophesies, his father and mother, to whom he was born, will say to him, `You must die, because you have told lies in the LORD's name.' When he prophesies, his own parents will stab him.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision. He will not put on a prophet's garment of hair in order to deceive.<DT>5 <DD>He will say, `I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup>  '<DT>6 <DD>If someone asks him, `What are these wounds on your body <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_2">2</a>]</sup>  ?' he will answer, `The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.'<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!&quot; declares the LORD Almighty. &quot;Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.<DT>8 <DD>In the whole land,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.<DT>9 <DD>This third I will bring into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, `They are my people,' and they will say, `The LORD is our God.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305023583_1">[5] Or <I>farmer; a man sold me in my youth</I></A></LI>
