</DL><B>Job 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!<DT>3 <DD>It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas-- no wonder my words have been impetuous.<DT>4 <DD>The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.<DT>5 <DD>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?<DT>6 <DD>Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>7 <DD>I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,<DT>9 <DD>that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!<DT>10 <DD>Then I would still have this consolation-- my joy in unrelenting pain-- that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?<DT>12 <DD>Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?<DT>13 <DD>Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me? <DT>14 <DD>&quot;A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.<DT>15 <DD>But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow<DT>16 <DD>when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,<DT>17 <DD>but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.<DT>18 <DD>Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.<DT>19 <DD>The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.<DT>20 <DD>They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.<DT>21 <DD>Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.<DT>22 <DD>Have I ever said, `Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,<DT>23 <DD>deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'? <DT>24 <DD>&quot;Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.<DT>25 <DD>How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?<DT>26 <DD>Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?<DT>27 <DD>You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend. <DT>28 <DD>&quot;But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?<DT>29 <DD>Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>30 <DD>Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice? </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_809591897_1">[6] The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.</A></LI>
