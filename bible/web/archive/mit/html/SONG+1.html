</DL><B>Song of Solomon 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Solomon's Song of Songs. <DT>2 <DD>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth-- for your love is more delightful than wine.<DT>3 <DD>Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!<DT>4 <DD>Take me away with you--let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you! <DT>5 <DD>Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_214350430_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>6 <DD>Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.<DT>7 <DD>Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?<DT>8 <DD>If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.<DT>9 <DD>I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.<DT>10 <DD>Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.<DT>11 <DD>We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.<DT>12 <DD>While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.<DT>13 <DD>My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.<DT>14 <DD>My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.<DT>15 <DD>How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.<DT>16 <DD>How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.<DT>17 <DD>The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_214350430_1">[4] The Hebrew is masculine singular.</A></LI>
