</DL><B>Luke 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--<DT>2 <DD>during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.<DT>3 <DD>He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.<DT>4 <DD>As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: &quot;A voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.<DT>5 <DD>Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.<DT>6 <DD>And all mankind will see God's salvation.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, &quot;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?<DT>8 <DD>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.<DT>9 <DD>The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>&quot;What should we do then?&quot; the crowd asked.<DT>11 <DD>John answered, &quot;The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Tax collectors also came to be baptized. &quot;Teacher,&quot; they asked, &quot;what should we do?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Don't collect any more than you are required to,&quot; he told them.<DT>14 <DD>Then some soldiers asked him, &quot;And what should we do?&quot; He replied, &quot;Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>John answered them all, &quot;I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_3">3</a>]</sup>   water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.<DT>17 <DD>His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.<DT>19 <DD>But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,<DT>20 <DD>Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.<DT>21 <DD>When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened<DT>22 <DD>and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: &quot;You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,<DT>24 <DD>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,<DT>25 <DD>the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,<DT>26 <DD>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,<DT>27 <DD>the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,<DT>28 <DD>the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,<DT>29 <DD>the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,<DT>30 <DD>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,<DT>31 <DD>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,<DT>32 <DD>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_4">4</a>]</sup>   the son of Nahshon,<DT>33 <DD>the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_5">5</a>]</sup>   the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,<DT>34 <DD>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,<DT>35 <DD>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,<DT>36 <DD>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,<DT>37 <DD>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,<DT>38 <DD>the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_121071346_1">[6] Isaiah 40:3-5</A></LI>
