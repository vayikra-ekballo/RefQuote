The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.'&quot;<DT>4 <DD>[The LORD said,] &quot;Say this to him: `This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land.<DT>5 <DD>Should you then seek great things for yourself?
