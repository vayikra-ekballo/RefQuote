</DL><B>2 Kings 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.<DT>2 <DD>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, &quot;Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, &quot;Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'<DT>4 <DD>Therefore this is what the LORD says: `You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'&quot; So Elijah went.<DT>5 <DD>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, &quot;Why have you come back?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>&quot;A man came to meet us,&quot; they replied. &quot;And he said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, &quot;This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&quot;'&quot;<DT>7 <DD>The king asked them, &quot;What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?&quot;<DT>8 <DD>They replied, &quot;He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist.&quot; The king said, &quot;That was Elijah the Tishbite.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &quot;Man of God, the king says, `Come down!'&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Elijah answered the captain, &quot;If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&quot; Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.<DT>11 <DD>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, &quot;Man of God, this is what the king says, `Come down at once!'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>&quot;If I am a man of God,&quot; Elijah replied, &quot;may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&quot; Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.<DT>13 <DD>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. &quot;Man of God,&quot; he begged, &quot;please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!<DT>14 <DD>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, &quot;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&quot; So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.<DT>16 <DD>He told the king, &quot;This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&quot;<DT>17 <DD>So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram <sup>[<a href="#footnote_68288699_1">1</a>]</sup>   succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.<DT>18 <DD>As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_68288699_1">[17] Hebrew <I>Jehoram,</I> a variant of <I>Joram</I></A></LI>
