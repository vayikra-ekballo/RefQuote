</DL><B>Ezekiel 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.<DT>3 <DD>Tell this rebellious house a parable and say to them: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`Put on the cooking pot; put it on and pour water into it.<DT>4 <DD>Put into it the pieces of meat, all the choice pieces--the leg and the shoulder. Fill it with the best of these bones;<DT>5 <DD>take the pick of the flock. Pile wood beneath it for the bones; bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;`For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted, whose deposit will not go away! Empty it piece by piece without casting lots for them. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;`For the blood she shed is in her midst: She poured it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, where the dust would cover it.<DT>8 <DD>To stir up wrath and take revenge I put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;`Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;`Woe to the city of bloodshed! I, too, will pile the wood high.<DT>10 <DD>So heap on the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well, mixing in the spices; and let the bones be charred.<DT>11 <DD>Then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows so its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away.<DT>12 <DD>It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy deposit has not been removed, not even by fire.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;`Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;`I the LORD have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Sovereign LORD.'&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>16 <DD>&quot;Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears.<DT>17 <DD>Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover the lower part of your face or eat the customary food [of mourners].&quot;<DT>18 <DD>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.<DT>19 <DD>Then the people asked me, &quot;Won't you tell us what these things have to do with us?&quot;<DT>20 <DD>So I said to them, &quot;The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>21 <DD>Say to the house of Israel, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary--the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.<DT>22 <DD>And you will do as I have done. You will not cover the lower part of your face or eat the customary food [of mourners].<DT>23 <DD>You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_188265317_1">1</a>]</sup>   your sins and groan among yourselves.<DT>24 <DD>Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.'<DT>25 <DD>&quot;And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart's desire, and their sons and daughters as well--<DT>26 <DD>on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news.<DT>27 <DD>At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak with him and will no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_188265317_1">[23] Or <I>away in</I></A></LI>
