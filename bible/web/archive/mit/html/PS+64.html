A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>Hear me, O God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.<DT>2 <DD>Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers. <DT>3 <DD>They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.<DT>4 <DD>They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear. <DT>5 <DD>They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, &quot;Who will see them <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup>  ?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>They plot injustice and say, &quot;We have devised a perfect plan!&quot; Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning. <DT>7 <DD>But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.<DT>8 <DD>He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn. <DT>9 <DD>All mankind will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.<DT>10 <DD>Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him; let all the upright in heart praise him! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_174971231_1">[5] Or <I>us</I></A></LI>
