</DL><B>Isaiah 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.<DT>2 <DD>Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: &quot;I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.<DT>3 <DD>The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.&quot; <DT>4 <DD>Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <DT>5 <DD>Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.<DT>6 <DD>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness-- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <DT>7 <DD>Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.<DT>8 <DD>The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.<DT>9 <DD>Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <DT>10 <DD>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!<DT>11 <DD>&quot;The multitude of your sacrifices-- what are they to me?&quot; says the LORD. &quot;I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.<DT>12 <DD>When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?<DT>13 <DD>Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations-- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.<DT>14 <DD>Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.<DT>15 <DD>When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;<DT>16 <DD>wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,<DT>17 <DD>learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup>   Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;Come now, let us reason together,&quot; says the LORD. &quot;Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.<DT>19 <DD>If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;<DT>20 <DD>but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.&quot;  For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <DT>21 <DD>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her-- but now murderers!<DT>22 <DD>Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.<DT>23 <DD>Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.<DT>24 <DD>Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: &quot;Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.<DT>25 <DD>I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.<DT>26 <DD>I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.&quot; <DT>27 <DD>Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.<DT>28 <DD>But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <DT>29 <DD>&quot;You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.<DT>30 <DD>You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.<DT>31 <DD>The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_172736232_1">[17] Or <I> rebuke the oppressor</I></A></LI>
