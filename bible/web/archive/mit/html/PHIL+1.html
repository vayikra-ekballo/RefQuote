</DL><B>Philippians 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,  To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_1">1</a>]</sup>   and deacons: <DT>2 <DD>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <DT>3 <DD>I thank my God every time I remember you.<DT>4 <DD>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy<DT>5 <DD>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,<DT>6 <DD>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.<DT>7 <DD>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.<DT>8 <DD>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.<DT>9 <DD>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,<DT>10 <DD>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,<DT>11 <DD>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.<DT>12 <DD>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.<DT>13 <DD>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_2">2</a>]</sup>   and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.<DT>14 <DD>Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.<DT>15 <DD>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.<DT>16 <DD>The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.<DT>17 <DD>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,<DT>19 <DD>for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>20 <DD>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.<DT>21 <DD>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.<DT>22 <DD>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!<DT>23 <DD>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;<DT>24 <DD>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.<DT>25 <DD>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,<DT>26 <DD>so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.<DT>27 <DD>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel<DT>28 <DD>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.<DT>29 <DD>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,<DT>30 <DD>since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_892662446_1">[1] Traditionally <I>bishops</I></A></LI>
