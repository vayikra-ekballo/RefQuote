</DL><B>Acts 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.<DT>2 <DD>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: &quot;We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.<DT>3 <DD>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.<DT>4 <DD>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect<DT>6 <DD>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.<DT>8 <DD>By <sup>[<a href="#footnote_947371799_1">1</a>]</sup>   examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.<DT>10 <DD>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: &quot;I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.<DT>11 <DD>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.<DT>12 <DD>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.<DT>13 <DD>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.<DT>14 <DD>However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,<DT>15 <DD>and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.<DT>16 <DD>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.<DT>18 <DD>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.<DT>19 <DD>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.<DT>20 <DD>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--<DT>21 <DD>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: `It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. &quot;When Lysias the commander comes,&quot; he said, &quot;I will decide your case.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.<DT>24 <DD>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.<DT>25 <DD>As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, &quot;That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.&quot;<DT>26 <DD>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.<DT>27 <DD>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_947371799_1">[6-8] Some manuscripts <I>him and wanted to judge him according to our law.
