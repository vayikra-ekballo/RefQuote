</DL><B>2 Chronicles 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.<DT>2 <DD>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel--to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families--<DT>3 <DD>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD's servant had made in the desert.<DT>4 <DD>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.<DT>5 <DD>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.<DT>6 <DD>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.<DT>7 <DD>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, &quot;Ask for whatever you want me to give you.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Solomon answered God, &quot;You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.<DT>9 <DD>Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.<DT>10 <DD>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>God said to Solomon, &quot;Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,<DT>12 <DD>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.<DT>14 <DD>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_9814227_1">1</a>]</sup>   which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.<DT>15 <DD>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.<DT>16 <DD>Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt <sup>[<a href="#footnote_9814227_2">2</a>]</sup>   and from Kue <sup>[<a href="#footnote_9814227_3">3</a>]</sup>  --the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.<DT>17 <DD>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_9814227_4">4</a>]</sup>   of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_9814227_5">5</a>]</sup>   They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_9814227_1">[14] Or <I>charioteers</I></A></LI>
