</DL><B>Job 39</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?<DT>2 <DD>Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?<DT>3 <DD>They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.<DT>4 <DD>Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?<DT>6 <DD>I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.<DT>7 <DD>He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.<DT>8 <DD>He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?<DT>10 <DD>Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?<DT>11 <DD>Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?<DT>12 <DD>Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor? <DT>13 <DD>&quot;The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.<DT>14 <DD>She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,<DT>15 <DD>unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.<DT>16 <DD>She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,<DT>17 <DD>for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.<DT>18 <DD>Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider. <DT>19 <DD>&quot;Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?<DT>20 <DD>Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?<DT>21 <DD>He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.<DT>22 <DD>He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.<DT>23 <DD>The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.<DT>24 <DD>In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.<DT>25 <DD>At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, `Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry. <DT>26 <DD>&quot;Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?<DT>27 <DD>Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?<DT>28 <DD>He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.<DT>29 <DD>From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.<DT>30 <DD>His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he.&quot; </DL><OL></OL>
