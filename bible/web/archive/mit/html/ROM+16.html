</DL><B>Romans 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant<sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup>  of the church in Cenchrea.<DT>2 <DD>I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me. <DT>3 <DD>Greet Priscilla<sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup>  and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.<DT>4 <DD>They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.<DT>5 <DD>Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.<DT>6 <DD>Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.<DT>7 <DD>Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.<DT>8 <DD>Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.<DT>9 <DD>Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.<DT>10 <DD>Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.<DT>11 <DD>Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.<DT>12 <DD>Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.<DT>13 <DD>Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.<DT>14 <DD>Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with them.<DT>15 <DD>Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.<DT>16 <DD>Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings. <DT>17 <DD>I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.<DT>18 <DD>For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.<DT>19 <DD>Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.<DT>20 <DD>The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.<DT>21 <DD>Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.<DT>22 <DD>I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.<DT>23 <DD>Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup> <DT>25 <DD>Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,<DT>26 <DD>but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him--<DT>27 <DD>to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ!
