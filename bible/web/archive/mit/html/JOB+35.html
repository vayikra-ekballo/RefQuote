</DL><B>Job 35</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Elihu said:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Do you think this is just? You say, `I will be cleared by God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup>  '<DT>3 <DD>Yet you ask him, `What profit is it to me, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup>   and what do I gain by not sinning?' <DT>4 <DD>&quot;I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.<DT>5 <DD>Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.<DT>6 <DD>If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?<DT>7 <DD>If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?<DT>8 <DD>Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.<DT>10 <DD>But no one says, `Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,<DT>11 <DD>who teaches more to us than to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup>   the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_4">4</a>]</sup>   the birds of the air?'<DT>12 <DD>He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.<DT>13 <DD>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.<DT>14 <DD>How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,<DT>15 <DD>and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_165763188_1">[2] Or <I>My righteousness is more than God's</I></A></LI>
