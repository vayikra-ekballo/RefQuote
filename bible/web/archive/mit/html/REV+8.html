</DL><B>Revelation 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.<DT>2 <DD>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.<DT>3 <DD>Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.<DT>4 <DD>The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand.<DT>5 <DD>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.<DT>6 <DD>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.<DT>7 <DD>The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.<DT>8 <DD>The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,<DT>9 <DD>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.<DT>10 <DD>The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water--<DT>11 <DD>the name of the star is Wormwood. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup>   A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.<DT>12 <DD>The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.<DT>13 <DD>As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: &quot;Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_117192532_1">[11] That is, Bitterness</A></LI>
