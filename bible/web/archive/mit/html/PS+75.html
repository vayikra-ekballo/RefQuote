</DL><B>Psalm 75</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 75  For the director of music. [To the tune of] &quot;Do Not Destroy.&quot; A psalm of Asaph. A song.<DT>1 <DD>We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near; men tell of your wonderful deeds. <DT>2 <DD>You say, &quot;I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.<DT>3 <DD>When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah<DT>4 <DD>To the arrogant I say, `Boast no more,' and to the wicked, `Do not lift up your horns.<DT>5 <DD>Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak with outstretched neck.'&quot; <DT>6 <DD>No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.<DT>7 <DD>But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.<DT>8 <DD>In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs. <DT>9 <DD>As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.<DT>10 <DD>I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up. </DL><OL></OL>
