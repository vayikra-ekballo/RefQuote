</DL><B>Proverbs 19</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse. <DT>2 <DD>It is not good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way. <DT>3 <DD>A man's own folly ruins his life, yet his heart rages against the LORD. <DT>4 <DD>Wealth brings many friends, but a poor man's friend deserts him. <DT>5 <DD>A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who pours out lies will not go free. <DT>6 <DD>Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of a man who gives gifts. <DT>7 <DD>A poor man is shunned by all his relatives-- how much more do his friends avoid him! Though he pursues them with pleading, they are nowhere to be found. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146641711_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>8 <DD>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; he who cherishes understanding prospers. <DT>9 <DD>A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who pours out lies will perish. <DT>10 <DD>It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury-- how much worse for a slave to rule over princes! <DT>11 <DD>A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense. <DT>12 <DD>A king's rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. <DT>13 <DD>A foolish son is his father's ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping. <DT>14 <DD>Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. <DT>15 <DD>Laziness brings on deep sleep, and the shiftless man goes hungry. <DT>16 <DD>He who obeys instructions guards his life, but he who is contemptuous of his ways will die. <DT>17 <DD>He who is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward him for what he has done. <DT>18 <DD>Discipline your son, for in that there is hope; do not be a willing party to his death. <DT>19 <DD>A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty; if you rescue him, you will have to do it again. <DT>20 <DD>Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise. <DT>21 <DD>Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. <DT>22 <DD>What a man desires is unfailing love <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146641711_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; better to be poor than a liar. <DT>23 <DD>The fear of the LORD leads to life: Then one rests content, untouched by trouble. <DT>24 <DD>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth! <DT>25 <DD>Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke a discerning man, and he will gain knowledge. <DT>26 <DD>He who robs his father and drives out his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace. <DT>27 <DD>Stop listening to instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge. <DT>28 <DD>A corrupt witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil. <DT>29 <DD>Penalties are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_146641711_1">[7] The meaning of the Hebrew for this sentence is uncertain.</A></LI>
