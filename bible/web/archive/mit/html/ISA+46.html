</DL><B>Isaiah 46</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_1">1</a>]</sup>   The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary.<DT>2 <DD>They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all you who remain of the house of Israel, you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, and have carried since your birth.<DT>4 <DD>Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;To whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?<DT>6 <DD>Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it.<DT>7 <DD>They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Though one cries out to it, it does not answer; it cannot save him from his troubles. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Remember this, fix it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels.<DT>9 <DD>Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me.<DT>10 <DD>I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say: My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.<DT>11 <DD>From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that will I bring about; what I have planned, that will I do.<DT>12 <DD>Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are far from righteousness.<DT>13 <DD>I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_199726480_1">[1] Or <I>are but beasts and cattle</I></A></LI>
