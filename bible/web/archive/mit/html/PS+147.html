Who can withstand his icy blast?<DT>18 <DD>He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow. <DT>19 <DD>He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel.<DT>20 <DD>He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws.  Praise the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_125000557_1">[1] Hebrew <I>Hallelu Yah</I>; also in verse 20</A></LI>
