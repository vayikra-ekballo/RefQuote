</DL><B>Exodus 26</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.<DT>2 <DD>All the curtains are to be the same size--twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.<DT>4 <DD>Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same with the end curtain in the other set.<DT>5 <DD>Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.<DT>6 <DD>Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a unit.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle--eleven altogether.<DT>8 <DD>All eleven curtains are to be the same size--thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>Join five of the curtains together into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.<DT>10 <DD>Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.<DT>11 <DD>Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to fasten the tent together as a unit.<DT>12 <DD>As for the additional length of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over is to hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.<DT>13 <DD>The tent curtains will be a cubit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_3">3</a>]</sup>   longer on both sides; what is left will hang over the sides of the tabernacle so as to cover it.<DT>14 <DD>Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>15 <DD>&quot;Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.<DT>16 <DD>Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_968956076_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>17 <DD>with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.<DT>18 <DD>Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle<DT>19 <DD>and make forty silver bases to go under them--two bases for each frame, one under each projection.<DT>20 <DD>For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, make twenty frames<DT>21 <DD>and forty silver bases--two under each frame.<DT>22 <DD>Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,<DT>23 <DD>and make two frames for the corners at the far end.<DT>24 <DD>At these two corners they must be double from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single ring; both shall be like that.<DT>25 <DD>So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases--two under each frame.<DT>26 <DD>&quot;Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,<DT>27 <DD>five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.<DT>28 <DD>The center crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.<DT>29 <DD>Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.<DT>30 <DD>&quot;Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.<DT>31 <DD>&quot;Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.<DT>32 <DD>Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.<DT>33 <DD>Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.<DT>34 <DD>Put the atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.<DT>35 <DD>Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side.<DT>36 <DD>&quot;For the entrance to the tent make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer.<DT>37 <DD>Make gold hooks for this curtain and five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold. And cast five bronze bases for them.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_968956076_1">[2] That is, about 42 feet (about 12.5 meters) long and 6 feet (about 1.8 meters) wide</A></LI>
