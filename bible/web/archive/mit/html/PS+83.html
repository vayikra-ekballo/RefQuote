</DL><B>Psalm 83</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 83  A song. A psalm of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>O God, do not keep silent; be not quiet, O God, be not still.<DT>2 <DD>See how your enemies are astir, how your foes rear their heads.<DT>3 <DD>With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Come,&quot; they say, &quot;let us destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more.&quot; <DT>5 <DD>With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you--<DT>6 <DD>the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,<DT>7 <DD>Gebal, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup>   Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.<DT>8 <DD>Even Assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of Lot. Selah <DT>9 <DD>Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,<DT>10 <DD>who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground.<DT>11 <DD>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,<DT>12 <DD>who said, &quot;Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.&quot; <DT>13 <DD>Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.<DT>14 <DD>As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,<DT>15 <DD>so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.<DT>16 <DD>Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name, O LORD. <DT>17 <DD>May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.<DT>18 <DD>Let them know that you, whose name is the LORD-- that you alone are the Most High over all the earth. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_256396507_1">[7] That is, Byblos</A></LI>
