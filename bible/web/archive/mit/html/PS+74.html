</DL><B>Psalm 74</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 74  A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_1">1</a>]</sup>   of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?<DT>2 <DD>Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed-- Mount Zion, where you dwelt.<DT>3 <DD>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary. <DT>4 <DD>Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.<DT>5 <DD>They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.<DT>6 <DD>They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.<DT>7 <DD>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.<DT>8 <DD>They said in their hearts, &quot;We will crush them completely!&quot; They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.<DT>9 <DD>We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be. <DT>10 <DD>How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?<DT>11 <DD>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them! <DT>12 <DD>But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.<DT>13 <DD>It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.<DT>14 <DD>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.<DT>15 <DD>It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.<DT>16 <DD>The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.<DT>17 <DD>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter. <DT>18 <DD>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.<DT>19 <DD>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.<DT>20 <DD>Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.<DT>21 <DD>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name. <DT>22 <DD>Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.<DT>23 <DD>Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_192609660_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
