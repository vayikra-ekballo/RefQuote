</DL><B>Zechariah 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Ask the LORD for rain in the springtime; it is the LORD who makes the storm clouds. He gives showers of rain to men, and plants of the field to everyone.<DT>2 <DD>The idols speak deceit, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD Almighty will care for his flock, the house of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle.<DT>4 <DD>From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler.<DT>5 <DD>Together they <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup>   will be like mighty men trampling the muddy streets in battle. Because the LORD is with them, they will fight and overthrow the horsemen. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.<DT>7 <DD>The Ephraimites will become like mighty men, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.<DT>8 <DD>I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before.<DT>9 <DD>Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return.<DT>10 <DD>I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them.<DT>11 <DD>They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria's pride will be brought down and Egypt's scepter will pass away.<DT>12 <DD>I will strengthen them in the LORD and in his name they will walk,&quot;  declares the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_121071346_1">[4,5] Or <I>ruler, all of them together.
