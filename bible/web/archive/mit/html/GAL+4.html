</DL><B>Galatians 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.<DT>2 <DD>He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.<DT>3 <DD>So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.<DT>4 <DD>But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,<DT>5 <DD>to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.<DT>6 <DD>Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, &quot;Abba, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_1">1</a>]</sup>   Father.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.<DT>8 <DD>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.<DT>9 <DD>But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?<DT>10 <DD>You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!<DT>11 <DD>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.<DT>12 <DD>I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.<DT>13 <DD>As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.<DT>14 <DD>Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.<DT>15 <DD>What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.<DT>16 <DD>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?<DT>17 <DD>Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you [from us], so that you may be zealous for them.<DT>18 <DD>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.<DT>19 <DD>My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,<DT>20 <DD>how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!<DT>21 <DD>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?<DT>22 <DD>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.<DT>23 <DD>His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.<DT>24 <DD>These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.<DT>25 <DD>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.<DT>26 <DD>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.<DT>27 <DD>For it is written: &quot;Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>28 <DD>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.<DT>29 <DD>At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.<DT>30 <DD>But what does the Scripture say? &quot;Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>31 <DD>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_333476998_1">[6] Aramaic for <I>Father</I></A></LI>
