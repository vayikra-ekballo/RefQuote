</DL><B>Psalm 39</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 39  For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>I said, &quot;I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.<DT>3 <DD>My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.<DT>5 <DD>You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. Selah<DT>6 <DD>Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.<DT>8 <DD>Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.<DT>9 <DD>I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.<DT>10 <DD>Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.<DT>11 <DD>You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth-- each man is but a breath. Selah <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Hear my prayer, O LORD, listen to my cry for help; be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien, a stranger, as all my fathers were.<DT>13 <DD>Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more.&quot; </DL><OL></OL>
