</DL><B>Judges 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim<DT>2 <DD>said to his mother, &quot;The eleven hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_1">1</a>]</sup>   of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse--I have that silver with me; I took it.&quot; Then his mother said, &quot;The LORD bless you, my son!&quot;<DT>3 <DD>When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, &quot;I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_2">2</a>]</sup>   of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.<DT>5 <DD>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.<DT>6 <DD>In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.<DT>7 <DD>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,<DT>8 <DD>left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_3">3</a>]</sup>   he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.<DT>9 <DD>Micah asked him, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; &quot;I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,&quot; he said, &quot;and I'm looking for a place to stay.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Then Micah said to him, &quot;Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_4">4</a>]</sup>   of silver a year, your clothes and your food.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.<DT>12 <DD>Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.<DT>13 <DD>And Micah said, &quot;Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_124154384_1">[2] That is, about 28 pounds (about 13 kilograms)</A></LI>
