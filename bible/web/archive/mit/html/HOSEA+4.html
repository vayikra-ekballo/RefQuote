</DL><B>Hosea 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: &quot;There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land.<DT>2 <DD>There is only cursing, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_1">1</a>]</sup>   lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.<DT>3 <DD>Because of this the land mourns, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_2">2</a>]</sup>   and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;But let no man bring a charge, let no man accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<DT>5 <DD>You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother--<DT>6 <DD>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge.  &quot;Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children.<DT>7 <DD>The more the priests increased, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_3">3</a>]</sup>   their <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_4">4</a>]</sup>   Glory for something disgraceful.<DT>8 <DD>They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.<DT>9 <DD>And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves<DT>11 <DD>to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding<DT>12 <DD>of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God.<DT>13 <DD>They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes-- a people without understanding will come to ruin! <DT>15 <DD>&quot;Though you commit adultery, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty.  &quot;Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_153074211_5">5</a>]</sup>   And do not swear, `As surely as the LORD lives!'<DT>16 <DD>The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?<DT>17 <DD>Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!<DT>18 <DD>Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways.<DT>19 <DD>A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_153074211_1">[2] That is, to pronounce a curse upon</A></LI>
