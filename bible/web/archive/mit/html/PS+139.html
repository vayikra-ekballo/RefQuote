</DL><B>Psalm 139</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 139  For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD, you have searched me and you know me.<DT>2 <DD>You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.<DT>3 <DD>You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.<DT>4 <DD>Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD. <DT>5 <DD>You hem me in--behind and before; you have laid your hand upon me.<DT>6 <DD>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. <DT>7 <DD>Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?<DT>8 <DD>If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_1">1</a>]</sup>   you are there.<DT>9 <DD>If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,<DT>10 <DD>even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. <DT>11 <DD>If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,&quot;<DT>12 <DD>even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. <DT>13 <DD>For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.<DT>14 <DD>I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.<DT>15 <DD>My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,<DT>16 <DD>your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be. <DT>17 <DD>How precious to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_2">2</a>]</sup>   me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!<DT>18 <DD>Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you. <DT>19 <DD>If only you would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!<DT>20 <DD>They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.<DT>21 <DD>Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you?<DT>22 <DD>I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies. <DT>23 <DD>Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.<DT>24 <DD>See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_410585287_1">[8] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
