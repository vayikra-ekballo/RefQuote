</DL><B>Titus 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness--<DT>2 <DD>a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,<DT>3 <DD>and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior, <DT>4 <DD>To Titus, my true son in our common faith:  Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. <DT>5 <DD>The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_1">1</a>]</sup>   elders in every town, as I directed you.<DT>6 <DD>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.<DT>7 <DD>Since an overseer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_100880827_2">2</a>]</sup>   is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.<DT>8 <DD>Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.<DT>9 <DD>He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.<DT>10 <DD>For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.<DT>11 <DD>They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach--and that for the sake of dishonest gain.<DT>12 <DD>Even one of their own prophets has said, &quot;Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith<DT>14 <DD>and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.<DT>15 <DD>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.<DT>16 <DD>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_100880827_1">[5] Or <I>ordain</I></A></LI>
