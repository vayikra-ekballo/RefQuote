</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.<DT>2 <DD>All share a common destiny--the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_1">1</a>]</sup>   the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.<DT>3 <DD>This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.<DT>4 <DD>Anyone who is among the living has hope <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_2">2</a>]</sup>  --even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!<DT>5 <DD>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.<DT>6 <DD>Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun. <DT>7 <DD>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.<DT>8 <DD>Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.<DT>9 <DD>Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun-- all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.<DT>10 <DD>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471366245_3">3</a>]</sup>   where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom. <DT>11 <DD>I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.<DT>12 <DD>Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.<DT>13 <DD>I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:<DT>14 <DD>There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.<DT>15 <DD>Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.<DT>16 <DD>So I said, &quot;Wisdom is better than strength.&quot; But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.<DT>17 <DD>The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.<DT>18 <DD>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_471366245_1">[2] Septuagint (Aquila), Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew does not have <I>and the bad.</I></A></LI>
