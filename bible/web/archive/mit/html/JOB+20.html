</DL><B>Job 20</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.<DT>3 <DD>I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_1">1</a>]</sup>   was placed on the earth,<DT>5 <DD>that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.<DT>6 <DD>Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,<DT>7 <DD>he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, `Where is he?'<DT>8 <DD>Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.<DT>9 <DD>The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.<DT>10 <DD>His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.<DT>11 <DD>The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,<DT>13 <DD>though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,<DT>14 <DD>yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.<DT>15 <DD>He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.<DT>16 <DD>He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.<DT>17 <DD>He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.<DT>18 <DD>What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.<DT>19 <DD>For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.<DT>21 <DD>Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.<DT>22 <DD>In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.<DT>23 <DD>When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.<DT>24 <DD>Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.<DT>25 <DD>He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;<DT>26 <DD>total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.<DT>27 <DD>The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.<DT>28 <DD>A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192609660_2">2</a>]</sup>   on the day of God's wrath.<DT>29 <DD>Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_192609660_1">[4] Or <I>Adam</I></A></LI>
