</DL><B>2 Samuel 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.<DT>2 <DD>He said: &quot;The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;<DT>3 <DD>my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_1">1</a>]</sup>   of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior-- from violent men you save me.<DT>4 <DD>I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.<DT>6 <DD>The cords of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_2">2</a>]</sup>   coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.<DT>7 <DD>In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_3">3</a>]</sup>   shook; they trembled because he was angry.<DT>9 <DD>Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.<DT>10 <DD>He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.<DT>11 <DD>He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_4">4</a>]</sup>   on the wings of the wind.<DT>12 <DD>He made darkness his canopy around him-- the dark <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_5">5</a>]</sup>   rain clouds of the sky.<DT>13 <DD>Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.<DT>14 <DD>The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.<DT>15 <DD>He shot arrows and scattered [the enemies], bolts of lightning and routed them.<DT>16 <DD>The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils. <DT>17 <DD>&quot;He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.<DT>18 <DD>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.<DT>19 <DD>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.<DT>20 <DD>He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.<DT>22 <DD>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.<DT>23 <DD>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.<DT>24 <DD>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.<DT>25 <DD>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_6">6</a>]</sup>   in his sight. <DT>26 <DD>&quot;To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,<DT>27 <DD>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.<DT>28 <DD>You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.<DT>29 <DD>You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.<DT>30 <DD>With your help I can advance against a troop <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_7">7</a>]</sup>  ; with my God I can scale a wall. <DT>31 <DD>&quot;As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.<DT>32 <DD>For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?<DT>33 <DD>It is God who arms me with strength <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_8">8</a>]</sup>   and makes my way perfect.<DT>34 <DD>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.<DT>35 <DD>He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.<DT>36 <DD>You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great.<DT>37 <DD>You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn. <DT>38 <DD>&quot;I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.<DT>39 <DD>I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.<DT>40 <DD>You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.<DT>41 <DD>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.<DT>42 <DD>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them-- to the LORD, but he did not answer.<DT>43 <DD>I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets. <DT>44 <DD>&quot;You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me,<DT>45 <DD>and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me.<DT>46 <DD>They all lose heart; they come trembling <sup>[<a href="#footnote_269991603_9">9</a>]</sup>   from their strongholds. <DT>47 <DD>&quot;The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!<DT>48 <DD>He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,<DT>49 <DD>who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.<DT>50 <DD>Therefore I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.<DT>51 <DD>He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_269991603_1">[3] <I>Horn</I> here symbolizes strength.</A></LI>
