</DL><B>Job 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?<DT>3 <DD>Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.<DT>4 <DD>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?<DT>5 <DD>He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.<DT>6 <DD>He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.<DT>7 <DD>He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.<DT>8 <DD>He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.<DT>9 <DD>He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.<DT>10 <DD>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.<DT>11 <DD>When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.<DT>12 <DD>If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, `What are you doing?'<DT>13 <DD>God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?<DT>15 <DD>Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.<DT>16 <DD>Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.<DT>17 <DD>He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.<DT>18 <DD>He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.<DT>19 <DD>If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_974960152_1">1</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>20 <DD>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.<DT>22 <DD>It is all the same; that is why I say, `He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'<DT>23 <DD>When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.<DT>24 <DD>When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it? <DT>25 <DD>&quot;My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.<DT>26 <DD>They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.<DT>27 <DD>If I say, `I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'<DT>28 <DD>I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.<DT>29 <DD>Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?<DT>30 <DD>Even if I washed myself with soap <sup>[<a href="#footnote_974960152_2">2</a>]</sup>   and my hands with washing soda,<DT>31 <DD>you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me. <DT>32 <DD>&quot;He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.<DT>33 <DD>If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,<DT>34 <DD>someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.<DT>35 <DD>Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_974960152_1">[19] See Septuagint; Hebrew <I>me.</I></A></LI>
