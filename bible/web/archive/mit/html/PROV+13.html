</DL><B>Proverbs 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A wise son heeds his father's instruction, but a mocker does not listen to rebuke. <DT>2 <DD>From the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things, but the unfaithful have a craving for violence. <DT>3 <DD>He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin. <DT>4 <DD>The sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied. <DT>5 <DD>The righteous hate what is false, but the wicked bring shame and disgrace. <DT>6 <DD>Righteousness guards the man of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner. <DT>7 <DD>One man pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. <DT>8 <DD>A man's riches may ransom his life, but a poor man hears no threat. <DT>9 <DD>The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out. <DT>10 <DD>Pride only breeds quarrels, but wisdom is found in those who take advice. <DT>11 <DD>Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow. <DT>12 <DD>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. <DT>13 <DD>He who scorns instruction will pay for it, but he who respects a command is rewarded. <DT>14 <DD>The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death. <DT>15 <DD>Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful is hard. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>16 <DD>Every prudent man acts out of knowledge, but a fool exposes his folly. <DT>17 <DD>A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy envoy brings healing. <DT>18 <DD>He who ignores discipline comes to poverty and shame, but whoever heeds correction is honored. <DT>19 <DD>A longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil. <DT>20 <DD>He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm. <DT>21 <DD>Misfortune pursues the sinner, but prosperity is the reward of the righteous. <DT>22 <DD>A good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children, but a sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous. <DT>23 <DD>A poor man's field may produce abundant food, but injustice sweeps it away. <DT>24 <DD>He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him. <DT>25 <DD>The righteous eat to their hearts' content, but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_77440980_1">[15] Or <I>unfaithful does not endure</I></A></LI>
