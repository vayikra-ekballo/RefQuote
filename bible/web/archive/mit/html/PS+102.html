</DL><B>Psalm 102</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 102  A prayer of an afflicted man. When he is faint and pours out his lament before the LORD.<DT>1 <DD>Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you.<DT>2 <DD>Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly. <DT>3 <DD>For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.<DT>4 <DD>My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.<DT>5 <DD>Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones.<DT>6 <DD>I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.<DT>7 <DD>I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.<DT>8 <DD>All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.<DT>9 <DD>For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears<DT>10 <DD>because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.<DT>11 <DD>My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass. <DT>12 <DD>But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.<DT>13 <DD>You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.<DT>14 <DD>For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.<DT>15 <DD>The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.<DT>16 <DD>For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.<DT>17 <DD>He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea. <DT>18 <DD>Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD:<DT>19 <DD>&quot;The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,<DT>20 <DD>to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem<DT>22 <DD>when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD. <DT>23 <DD>In the course of my life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_199726480_1">1</a>]</sup>   he broke my strength; he cut short my days.<DT>24 <DD>So I said: &quot;Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.<DT>25 <DD>In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.<DT>26 <DD>They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.<DT>27 <DD>But you remain the same, and your years will never end.<DT>28 <DD>The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_199726480_1">[23] Or <I>By his power</I></A></LI>
