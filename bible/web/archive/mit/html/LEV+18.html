</DL><B>Leviticus 18</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `I am the LORD your God.<DT>3 <DD>You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices.<DT>4 <DD>You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the LORD your God.<DT>5 <DD>Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the LORD.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;`No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;`Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her.<DT>8 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; that would dishonor you.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.<DT>12 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your father's sister; she is your father's close relative.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister, because she is your mother's close relative.<DT>14 <DD>&quot;`Do not dishonor your father's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; do not have relations with her.<DT>16 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife; that would dishonor your brother.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sexual relations with either her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness.<DT>18 <DD>&quot;`Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.<DT>19 <DD>&quot;`Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.<DT>20 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with your neighbor's wife and defile yourself with her.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;`Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup>   to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.<DT>22 <DD>&quot;`Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.<DT>23 <DD>&quot;`Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;`Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.<DT>25 <DD>Even the land was defiled; so I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.<DT>26 <DD>But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things,<DT>27 <DD>for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled.<DT>28 <DD>And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.<DT>29 <DD>&quot;`Everyone who does any of these detestable things--such persons must be cut off from their people.<DT>30 <DD>Keep my requirements and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you came and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the LORD your God.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102876638_1">[21] Or <I>to be passed through [the fire]</I></A></LI>
