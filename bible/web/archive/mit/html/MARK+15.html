</DL><B>Mark 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; asked Pilate. &quot;Yes, it is as you say,&quot; Jesus replied.<DT>3 <DD>The chief priests accused him of many things.<DT>4 <DD>So again Pilate asked him, &quot;Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.<DT>6 <DD>Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.<DT>7 <DD>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.<DT>8 <DD>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&quot; asked Pilate,<DT>10 <DD>knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.<DT>11 <DD>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.<DT>12 <DD>&quot;What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?&quot; Pilate asked them.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Crucify him!&quot; they shouted.<DT>14 <DD>&quot;Why? What crime has he committed?&quot; asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.<DT>16 <DD>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.<DT>17 <DD>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.<DT>18 <DD>And they began to call out to him, &quot;Hail, king of the Jews!&quot;<DT>19 <DD>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.<DT>20 <DD>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.<DT>21 <DD>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.<DT>22 <DD>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).<DT>23 <DD>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.<DT>24 <DD>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.<DT>25 <DD>It was the third hour when they crucified him.<DT>26 <DD>The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.<DT>27 <DD>They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>29 <DD>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, &quot;So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,<DT>30 <DD>come down from the cross and save yourself!&quot;<DT>31 <DD>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. &quot;He saved others,&quot; they said, &quot;but he can't save himself!<DT>32 <DD>Let this Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_2">2</a>]</sup>   this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.&quot; Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.<DT>33 <DD>At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<DT>34 <DD>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot;--which means, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<DT>35 <DD>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, &quot;Listen, he's calling Elijah.&quot;<DT>36 <DD>One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. &quot;Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,&quot; he said.<DT>37 <DD>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.<DT>38 <DD>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.<DT>39 <DD>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_3">3</a>]</sup>   saw how he died, he said, &quot;Surely this man was the Son <sup>[<a href="#footnote_471171087_4">4</a>]</sup>   of God!&quot;<DT>40 <DD>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.<DT>41 <DD>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.<DT>42 <DD>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,<DT>43 <DD>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.<DT>44 <DD>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.<DT>45 <DD>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.<DT>46 <DD>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.<DT>47 <DD>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_471171087_1">[27] Some manuscripts <I>left, [28] and the scripture was fulfilled which says, "He was counted with the lawless ones"</I> (Isaiah 53:12)</A></LI>
