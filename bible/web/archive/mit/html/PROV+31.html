</DL><B>Proverbs 31</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The sayings of King Lemuel--an oracle <sup>[<a href="#footnote_103805589_1">1</a>]</sup>   his mother taught him:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_103805589_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;It is not for kings, O Lemuel-- not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer,<DT>5 <DD>lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.<DT>6 <DD>Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish;<DT>7 <DD>let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.<DT>9 <DD>Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.&quot; <DT>10 <DD> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_103805589_3">3</a>]</sup>    A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.<DT>11 <DD>Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.<DT>12 <DD>She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.<DT>13 <DD>She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.<DT>14 <DD>She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.<DT>15 <DD>She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.<DT>16 <DD>She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.<DT>17 <DD>She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.<DT>18 <DD>She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.<DT>19 <DD>In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.<DT>20 <DD>She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.<DT>21 <DD>When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.<DT>22 <DD>She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.<DT>23 <DD>Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.<DT>24 <DD>She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.<DT>25 <DD>She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.<DT>26 <DD>She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.<DT>27 <DD>She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.<DT>28 <DD>Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:<DT>29 <DD>&quot;Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.<DT>31 <DD>Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_103805589_1">[1] Or <I>of Lemuel king of Massa, which</I></A></LI>
