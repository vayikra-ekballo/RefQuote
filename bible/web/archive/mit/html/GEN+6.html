</DL><B>Genesis 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,<DT>2 <DD>the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.<DT>3 <DD>Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit will not contend with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup>   man forever, for he is mortal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.<DT>5 <DD>The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.<DT>6 <DD>The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain.<DT>7 <DD>So the LORD said, &quot;I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth--men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air--for I am grieved that I have made them.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. <DT>9 <DD>This is the account of Noah.  Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God.<DT>10 <DD>Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.<DT>11 <DD>Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.<DT>12 <DD>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.<DT>13 <DD>So God said to Noah, &quot;I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.<DT>14 <DD>So make yourself an ark of cypress <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_3">3</a>]</sup>   wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.<DT>15 <DD>This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>Make a roof for it and finish <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_5">5</a>]</sup>   the ark to within 18 inches <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_6">6</a>]</sup>   of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.<DT>17 <DD>I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.<DT>18 <DD>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.<DT>19 <DD>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.<DT>20 <DD>Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.<DT>21 <DD>You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Noah did everything just as God commanded him.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_111776534_1">[3] Or <I>My spirit will not remain in</I></A></LI>
