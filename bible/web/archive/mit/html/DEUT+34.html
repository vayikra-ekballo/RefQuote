</DL><B>Deuteronomy 34</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land--from Gilead to Dan,<DT>2 <DD>all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.<DT>4 <DD>Then the LORD said to him, &quot;This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, `I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.<DT>6 <DD>He buried him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_2">2</a>]</sup>   in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.<DT>7 <DD>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.<DT>8 <DD>The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.<DT>9 <DD>Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_77440980_3">3</a>]</sup>   of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.<DT>10 <DD>Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,<DT>11 <DD>who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.<DT>12 <DD>For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_77440980_1">[2] That is, the Mediterranean</A></LI>
