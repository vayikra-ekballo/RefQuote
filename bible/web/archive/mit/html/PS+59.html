</DL><B>Psalm 59</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 59  For the director of music. [To the tune of] &quot;Do Not Destroy.&quot; Of David. A miktam. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup>   When Saul had sent men to watch David's house in order to kill him.<DT>1 <DD>Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me.<DT>2 <DD>Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men. <DT>3 <DD>See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, O LORD.<DT>4 <DD>I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!<DT>5 <DD>O LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah <DT>6 <DD>They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.<DT>7 <DD>See what they spew from their mouths-- they spew out swords from their lips, and they say, &quot;Who can hear us?&quot;<DT>8 <DD>But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations. <DT>9 <DD>O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O God, are my fortress,<DT>10 <DD>my loving God.  God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.<DT>11 <DD>But do not kill them, O Lord our shield, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_2">2</a>]</sup>   or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about, and bring them down.<DT>12 <DD>For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,<DT>13 <DD>consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah <DT>14 <DD>They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.<DT>15 <DD>They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.<DT>16 <DD>But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble. <DT>17 <DD>O my Strength, I sing praise to you; you, O God, are my fortress, my loving God. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_111776534_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
