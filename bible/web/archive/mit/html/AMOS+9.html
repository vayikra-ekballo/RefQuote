</DL><B>Amos 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: &quot;Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape.<DT>2 <DD>Though they dig down to the depths of the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup>   from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.<DT>3 <DD>Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.<DT>4 <DD>Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. I will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>The Lord, the LORD Almighty, he who touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn-- the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt--<DT>6 <DD>he who builds his lofty palace <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_2">2</a>]</sup>   in the heavens and sets its foundation <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_3">3</a>]</sup>   on the earth, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land-- the LORD is his name.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_4">4</a>]</sup>  ?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_5">5</a>]</sup>   and the Arameans from Kir?<DT>8 <DD>&quot;Surely the eyes of the Sovereign LORD are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth-- yet I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;For I will give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.<DT>10 <DD>All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say, `Disaster will not overtake or meet us.'<DT>11 <DD>&quot;In that day I will restore David's fallen tent. I will repair its broken places, restore its ruins, and build it as it used to be,<DT>12 <DD>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_6">6</a>]</sup>  &quot; declares the LORD, who will do these things.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;The days are coming,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes. New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills.<DT>14 <DD>I will bring back my exiled <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_7">7</a>]</sup>   people Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.<DT>15 <DD>I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them,&quot; says the LORD your God.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_184292258_1">[2] Hebrew <I>to Sheol</I></A></LI>
