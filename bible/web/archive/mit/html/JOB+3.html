</DL><B>Job 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.<DT>2 <DD>He said:<DT>3 <DD>&quot;May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, `A boy is born!'<DT>4 <DD>That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.<DT>5 <DD>May darkness and deep shadow <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup>   claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.<DT>6 <DD>That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.<DT>7 <DD>May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.<DT>8 <DD>May those who curse days <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup>   curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.<DT>9 <DD>May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,<DT>10 <DD>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?<DT>12 <DD>Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?<DT>13 <DD>For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest<DT>14 <DD>with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,<DT>15 <DD>with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.<DT>16 <DD>Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?<DT>17 <DD>There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.<DT>18 <DD>Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.<DT>19 <DD>The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,<DT>21 <DD>to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,<DT>22 <DD>who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?<DT>23 <DD>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?<DT>24 <DD>For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.<DT>25 <DD>What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.<DT>26 <DD>I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_172736232_1">[5] Or <I>and the shadow of death</I></A></LI>
