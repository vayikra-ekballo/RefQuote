</DL><B>Psalm 60</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 60  For the director of music. To [the tune of] &quot;The Lily of the Covenant.&quot; A miktam <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup>   of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup>   and Aram Zobah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_3">3</a>]</sup>   and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.<DT>1 <DD>You have rejected us, O God, and burst forth upon us; you have been angry--now restore us!<DT>2 <DD>You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.<DT>3 <DD>You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger. <DT>4 <DD>But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Selah <DT>5 <DD>Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.<DT>6 <DD>God has spoken from his sanctuary: &quot;In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.<DT>7 <DD>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.<DT>8 <DD>Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?<DT>10 <DD>Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?<DT>11 <DD>Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.<DT>12 <DD>With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_809591897_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
