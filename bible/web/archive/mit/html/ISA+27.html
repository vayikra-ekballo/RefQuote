</DL><B>Isaiah 27</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerful sword, Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea.<DT>2 <DD>In that day-- &quot;Sing about a fruitful vineyard:<DT>3 <DD>I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.<DT>4 <DD>I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.<DT>5 <DD>Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me.&quot; <DT>6 <DD>In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit. <DT>7 <DD>Has [the LORD] struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?<DT>8 <DD>By warfare <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_1">1</a>]</sup>   and exile you contend with her-- with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.<DT>9 <DD>By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_2">2</a>]</sup>   or incense altars will be left standing.<DT>10 <DD>The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.<DT>11 <DD>When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.<DT>12 <DD>In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates <sup>[<a href="#footnote_256396507_3">3</a>]</sup>   to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.<DT>13 <DD>And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_256396507_1">[8] See Septuagint; the meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
