</DL><B>Isaiah 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley-- to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!<DT>2 <DD>See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.<DT>3 <DD>That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.<DT>4 <DD>That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest-- as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it. <DT>5 <DD>In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.<DT>6 <DD>He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. <DT>7 <DD>And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.<DT>8 <DD>All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?<DT>10 <DD>For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; a little here, a little there.&quot; <DT>11 <DD>Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,<DT>12 <DD>to whom he said, &quot;This is the resting place, let the weary rest&quot;; and, &quot;This is the place of repose&quot;-- but they would not listen.<DT>13 <DD>So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there-- so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured. <DT>14 <DD>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.<DT>15 <DD>You boast, &quot;We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup>   we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup>   our hiding place.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.<DT>17 <DD>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.<DT>18 <DD>Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.<DT>19 <DD>As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.&quot;  The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.<DT>20 <DD>The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.<DT>21 <DD>The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon-- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.<DT>22 <DD>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. <DT>23 <DD>Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.<DT>24 <DD>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?<DT>25 <DD>When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup>   barley in its plot, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup>   and spelt in its field?<DT>26 <DD>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. <DT>27 <DD>Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.<DT>28 <DD>Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.<DT>29 <DD>All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102876638_1">[10] Hebrew <I> sav lasav sav lasav  kav lakav kav lakav</I> (possibly meaningless sounds; perhaps a mimicking of the prophet's words); also in verse 13</A></LI>
