</DL><B>Psalm 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 28  Of David.<DT>1 <DD>To you I call, O LORD my Rock; do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who have gone down to the pit.<DT>2 <DD>Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. <DT>3 <DD>Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.<DT>4 <DD>Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve.<DT>5 <DD>Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again. <DT>6 <DD>Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy.<DT>7 <DD>The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song. <DT>8 <DD>The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.<DT>9 <DD>Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever. </DL><OL></OL>
