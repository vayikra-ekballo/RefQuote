</DL><B>Romans 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit--<DT>2 <DD>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.<DT>3 <DD>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,<DT>4 <DD>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.<DT>5 <DD>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_1">1</a>]</sup>   Amen.<DT>6 <DD>It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.<DT>7 <DD>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, &quot;It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.<DT>9 <DD>For this was how the promise was stated: &quot;At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>10 <DD>Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.<DT>11 <DD>Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand:<DT>12 <DD>not by works but by him who calls--she was told, &quot;The older will serve the younger.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>13 <DD>Just as it is written: &quot;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!<DT>15 <DD>For he says to Moses, &quot;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_6">6</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.<DT>17 <DD>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: &quot;I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_7">7</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.<DT>19 <DD>One of you will say to me: &quot;Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?&quot;<DT>20 <DD>But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? &quot;Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, `Why did you make me like this?'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_8">8</a>]</sup>  <DT>21 <DD>Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?<DT>22 <DD>What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction?<DT>23 <DD>What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory--<DT>24 <DD>even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?<DT>25 <DD>As he says in Hosea: &quot;I will call them `my people' who are not my people; and I will call her `my loved one' who is not my loved one,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_9">9</a>]</sup>  <DT>26 <DD>and, &quot;It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, `You are not my people,' they will be called `sons of the living God.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_10">10</a>]</sup>  <DT>27 <DD>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: &quot;Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.<DT>28 <DD>For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_11">11</a>]</sup>  <DT>29 <DD>It is just as Isaiah said previously: &quot;Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_12">12</a>]</sup>  <DT>30 <DD>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;<DT>31 <DD>but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.<DT>32 <DD>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the &quot;stumbling stone.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>As it is written: &quot;See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_13">13</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_565097987_1">[5] Or <I>Christ, who is over all.
