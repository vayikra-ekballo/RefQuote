</DL><B>2 John 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The elder,  To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--<DT>2 <DD>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever: <DT>3 <DD>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love. <DT>4 <DD>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.<DT>5 <DD>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.<DT>6 <DD>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.<DT>7 <DD>Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.<DT>8 <DD>Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.<DT>9 <DD>Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.<DT>10 <DD>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.<DT>11 <DD>Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.<DT>12 <DD>I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. <DT>13 <DD>The children of your chosen sister send their greetings. </DL><OL></OL>
