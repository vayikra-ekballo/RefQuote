</DL><B>Mark 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>2 <DD>It is written in Isaiah the prophet: &quot;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_2">2</a>]</sup>  --<DT>3 <DD>&quot;a voice of one calling in the desert, `Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.<DT>5 <DD>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.<DT>6 <DD>John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.<DT>7 <DD>And this was his message: &quot;After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.<DT>8 <DD>I baptize you with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_4">4</a>]</sup>   water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.<DT>10 <DD>As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.<DT>11 <DD>And a voice came from heaven: &quot;You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,<DT>13 <DD>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.<DT>14 <DD>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;The time has come,&quot; he said. &quot;The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!&quot;<DT>16 <DD>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Come, follow me,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;and I will make you fishers of men.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>At once they left their nets and followed him.<DT>19 <DD>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.<DT>20 <DD>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.<DT>21 <DD>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.<DT>22 <DD>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.<DT>23 <DD>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_5">5</a>]</sup>   spirit cried out,<DT>24 <DD>&quot;What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!&quot;<DT>25 <DD>&quot;Be quiet!&quot; said Jesus sternly. &quot;Come out of him!&quot;<DT>26 <DD>The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.<DT>27 <DD>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, &quot;What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.<DT>29 <DD>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.<DT>30 <DD>Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.<DT>31 <DD>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.<DT>32 <DD>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.<DT>33 <DD>The whole town gathered at the door,<DT>34 <DD>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.<DT>35 <DD>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.<DT>36 <DD>Simon and his companions went to look for him,<DT>37 <DD>and when they found him, they exclaimed: &quot;Everyone is looking for you!&quot;<DT>38 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.&quot;<DT>39 <DD>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.<DT>40 <DD>A man with leprosy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_6">6</a>]</sup>   came to him and begged him on his knees, &quot;If you are willing, you can make me clean.&quot;<DT>41 <DD>Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. &quot;I am willing,&quot; he said. &quot;Be clean!&quot;<DT>42 <DD>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.<DT>43 <DD>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:<DT>44 <DD>&quot;See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.&quot;<DT>45 <DD>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_430775305_1">[1] Some manuscripts do not have <I>the Son of God.</I></A></LI>
