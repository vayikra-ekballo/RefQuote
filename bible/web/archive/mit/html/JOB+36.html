</DL><B>Job 36</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Elihu continued:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.<DT>3 <DD>I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.<DT>4 <DD>Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.<DT>6 <DD>He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.<DT>7 <DD>He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.<DT>8 <DD>But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,<DT>9 <DD>he tells them what they have done-- that they have sinned arrogantly.<DT>10 <DD>He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.<DT>11 <DD>If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.<DT>12 <DD>But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   and die without knowledge. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.<DT>14 <DD>They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.<DT>15 <DD>But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.<DT>17 <DD>But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.<DT>18 <DD>Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.<DT>19 <DD>Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?<DT>20 <DD>Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>21 <DD>Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction. <DT>22 <DD>&quot;God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?<DT>23 <DD>Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, `You have done wrong'?<DT>24 <DD>Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.<DT>25 <DD>All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.<DT>26 <DD>How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out. <DT>27 <DD>&quot;He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_3">3</a>]</sup>  ;<DT>28 <DD>the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.<DT>29 <DD>Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?<DT>30 <DD>See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.<DT>31 <DD>This is the way he governs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_4">4</a>]</sup>   the nations and provides food in abundance.<DT>32 <DD>He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.<DT>33 <DD>His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_5">5</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[12] Or <I>will cross the River</I></A></LI>
