</DL><B>Psalm 49</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 49  For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,<DT>2 <DD>both low and high, rich and poor alike:<DT>3 <DD>My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.<DT>4 <DD>I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: <DT>5 <DD>Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me--<DT>6 <DD>those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?<DT>7 <DD>No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him--<DT>8 <DD>the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough--<DT>9 <DD>that he should live on forever and not see decay. <DT>10 <DD>For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others.<DT>11 <DD>Their tombs will remain their houses <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_1">1</a>]</sup>   forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_2">2</a>]</sup>   named lands after themselves. <DT>12 <DD>But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_3">3</a>]</sup>   like the beasts that perish. <DT>13 <DD>This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah<DT>14 <DD>Like sheep they are destined for the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_4">4</a>]</sup>   and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_5">5</a>]</sup>   far from their princely mansions.<DT>15 <DD>But God will redeem my life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_939746968_6">6</a>]</sup>   from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah <DT>16 <DD>Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases;<DT>17 <DD>for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him.<DT>18 <DD>Though while he lived he counted himself blessed-- and men praise you when you prosper--<DT>19 <DD>he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light [of life]. <DT>20 <DD>A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_939746968_1">[11] Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew <I>In their thoughts their houses will remain</I></A></LI>
