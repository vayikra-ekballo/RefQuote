</DL><B>Isaiah 52</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Awake, awake, O Zion, clothe yourself with strength. Put on your garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again.<DT>2 <DD>Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.<DT>3 <DD>For this is what the LORD says: &quot;You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;At first my people went down to Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has oppressed them.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;And now what do I have here?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For my people have been taken away for nothing, and those who rule them mock, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_1">1</a>]</sup>  &quot;  declares the LORD. &quot;And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed.<DT>6 <DD>Therefore my people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I.&quot; <DT>7 <DD>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, &quot;Your God reigns!&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; together they shout for joy. When the LORD returns to Zion, they will see it with their own eyes.<DT>9 <DD>Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.<DT>10 <DD>The LORD will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God. <DT>11 <DD>Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.<DT>12 <DD>But you will not leave in haste or go in flight; for the LORD will go before you, the God of Israel will be your rear guard. <DT>13 <DD>See, my servant will act wisely <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.<DT>14 <DD>Just as there were many who were appalled at him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_3">3</a>]</sup>  -- his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness--<DT>15 <DD>so will he sprinkle many nations, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174670748_4">4</a>]</sup>   and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_174670748_1">[5] Dead Sea Scrolls and Vulgate; Masoretic Text <I>wail</I></A></LI>
