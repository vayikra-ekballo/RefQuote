</DL><B>John 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.<DT>2 <DD>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_1">1</a>]</sup>   and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.<DT>3 <DD>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD><DT>5 <DD>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.<DT>6 <DD>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, &quot;Do you want to get well?&quot;<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Sir,&quot; the invalid replied, &quot;I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,<DT>10 <DD>and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, &quot;It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>But he replied, &quot;The man who made me well said to me, `Pick up your mat and walk.'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>So they asked him, &quot;Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.<DT>14 <DD>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, &quot;See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.<DT>16 <DD>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.<DT>17 <DD>Jesus said to them, &quot;My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.<DT>19 <DD>Jesus gave them this answer: &quot;I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.<DT>20 <DD>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.<DT>21 <DD>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.<DT>22 <DD>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,<DT>23 <DD>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.<DT>25 <DD>I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.<DT>26 <DD>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.<DT>27 <DD>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.<DT>28 <DD>&quot;Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice<DT>29 <DD>and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.<DT>30 <DD>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.<DT>31 <DD>&quot;If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.<DT>32 <DD>There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.<DT>33 <DD>&quot;You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.<DT>34 <DD>Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.<DT>35 <DD>John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.<DT>36 <DD>&quot;I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.<DT>37 <DD>And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,<DT>38 <DD>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.<DT>39 <DD>You diligently study <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_3">3</a>]</sup>   the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,<DT>40 <DD>yet you refuse to come to me to have life.<DT>41 <DD>&quot;I do not accept praise from men,<DT>42 <DD>but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.<DT>43 <DD>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.<DT>44 <DD>How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121071346_4">4</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>45 <DD>&quot;But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.<DT>46 <DD>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.<DT>47 <DD>But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_121071346_1">[2] Some manuscripts <I>Bethzatha</I>; other manuscripts <I>Bethsaida</I></A></LI>
