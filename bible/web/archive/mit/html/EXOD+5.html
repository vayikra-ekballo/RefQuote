</DL><B>Exodus 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, &quot;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'&quot;<DT>2 <DD>Pharaoh said, &quot;Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then they said, &quot;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>But the king of Egypt said, &quot;Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!&quot;<DT>5 <DD>Then Pharaoh said, &quot;Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people:<DT>7 <DD>&quot;You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.<DT>8 <DD>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, `Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'<DT>9 <DD>Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, &quot;This is what Pharaoh says: `I will not give you any more straw.<DT>11 <DD>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.<DT>13 <DD>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, &quot;Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, &quot;Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: &quot;Why have you treated your servants this way?<DT>16 <DD>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, `Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>Pharaoh said, &quot;Lazy, that's what you are--lazy! That is why you keep saying, `Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'<DT>18 <DD>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, &quot;You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,<DT>21 <DD>and they said, &quot;May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Moses returned to the LORD and said, &quot;O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?<DT>23 <DD>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
