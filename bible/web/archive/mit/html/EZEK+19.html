</DL><B>Ezekiel 19</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel<DT>2 <DD>and say: &quot;`What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.<DT>3 <DD>She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.<DT>4 <DD>The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;`When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.<DT>6 <DD>He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.<DT>7 <DD>He broke down <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_1">1</a>]</sup>   their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.<DT>8 <DD>Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit.<DT>9 <DD>With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;`Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_2">2</a>]</sup>   planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.<DT>11 <DD>Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.<DT>12 <DD>But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.<DT>13 <DD>Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land.<DT>14 <DD>Fire spread from one of its main <sup>[<a href="#footnote_177239497_3">3</a>]</sup>   branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler's scepter.' This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_177239497_1">[7] Targum (see Septuagint); Hebrew <I>He knew</I></A></LI>
