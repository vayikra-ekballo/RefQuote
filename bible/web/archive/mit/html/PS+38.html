</DL><B>Psalm 38</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 38  A psalm of David. A petition.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.<DT>2 <DD>For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.<DT>3 <DD>Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin.<DT>4 <DD>My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. <DT>5 <DD>My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.<DT>6 <DD>I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.<DT>7 <DD>My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.<DT>8 <DD>I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart. <DT>9 <DD>All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.<DT>10 <DD>My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.<DT>11 <DD>My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.<DT>12 <DD>Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception. <DT>13 <DD>I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;<DT>14 <DD>I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.<DT>15 <DD>I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.<DT>16 <DD>For I said, &quot;Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.&quot; <DT>17 <DD>For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.<DT>18 <DD>I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.<DT>19 <DD>Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.<DT>20 <DD>Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good. <DT>21 <DD>O LORD, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God.<DT>22 <DD>Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior. </DL><OL></OL>
