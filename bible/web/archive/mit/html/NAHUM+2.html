</DL><B>Nahum 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An attacker advances against you, [Nineveh]. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength! <DT>2 <DD>The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines. <DT>3 <DD>The shields of his soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of pine are brandished. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning. <DT>5 <DD>He summons his picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place.<DT>6 <DD>The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.<DT>7 <DD>It is decreed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_2">2</a>]</sup>   that [the city] be exiled and carried away. Its slave girls moan like doves and beat upon their breasts.<DT>8 <DD>Nineveh is like a pool, and its water is draining away. &quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; they cry, but no one turns back.<DT>9 <DD>Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!<DT>10 <DD>She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale. <DT>11 <DD>Where now is the lions' den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?<DT>12 <DD>The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;I am against you,&quot; declares the LORD Almighty. &quot;I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_124164828_1">[3] Hebrew; Septuagint and Syriac  <I>the horsemen rush to and fro</I></A></LI>
