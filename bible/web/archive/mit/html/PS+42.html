</DL><B>Psalm 42</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 42  For the director of music. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_1">1</a>]</sup>   of the Sons of Korah.  <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>1 <DD>As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God.<DT>2 <DD>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?<DT>3 <DD>My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, &quot;Where is your God?&quot;<DT>4 <DD>These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng. <DT>5 <DD>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and<DT>6 <DD>my God.  My <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200280896_3">3</a>]</sup>   soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar.<DT>7 <DD>Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me. <DT>8 <DD>By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me-- a prayer to the God of my life. <DT>9 <DD>I say to God my Rock, &quot;Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?&quot;<DT>10 <DD>My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, &quot;Where is your God?&quot; <DT>11 <DD>Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_200280896_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
