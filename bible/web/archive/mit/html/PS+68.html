</DL><B>Psalm 68</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 68  For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. A song.<DT>1 <DD>May God arise, may his enemies be scattered; may his foes flee before him.<DT>2 <DD>As smoke is blown away by the wind, may you blow them away; as wax melts before the fire, may the wicked perish before God.<DT>3 <DD>But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; may they be happy and joyful. <DT>4 <DD>Sing to God, sing praise to his name, extol him who rides on the clouds <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup>  -- his name is the LORD-- and rejoice before him.<DT>5 <DD>A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.<DT>6 <DD>God sets the lonely in families, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup>   he leads forth the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land. <DT>7 <DD>When you went out before your people, O God, when you marched through the wasteland, Selah<DT>8 <DD>the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.<DT>9 <DD>You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance.<DT>10 <DD>Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, O God, you provided for the poor. <DT>11 <DD>The Lord announced the word, and great was the company of those who proclaimed it:<DT>12 <DD>&quot;Kings and armies flee in haste; in the camps men divide the plunder.<DT>13 <DD>Even while you sleep among the campfires, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup>   the wings of [my] dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>When the Almighty <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_4">4</a>]</sup>   scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Zalmon. <DT>15 <DD>The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains; rugged are the mountains of Bashan.<DT>16 <DD>Why gaze in envy, O rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the LORD himself will dwell forever?<DT>17 <DD>The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord [has come] from Sinai into his sanctuary.<DT>18 <DD>When you ascended on high, you led captives in your train; you received gifts from men, even from <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_5">5</a>]</sup>   the rebellious-- that you, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_6">6</a>]</sup>   O LORD God, might dwell there. <DT>19 <DD>Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Selah<DT>20 <DD>Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death. <DT>21 <DD>Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.<DT>22 <DD>The Lord says, &quot;I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea,<DT>23 <DD>that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share.&quot; <DT>24 <DD>Your procession has come into view, O God, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.<DT>25 <DD>In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the maidens playing tambourines.<DT>26 <DD>Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel.<DT>27 <DD>There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah's princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali. <DT>28 <DD>Summon your power, O God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_7">7</a>]</sup>  ; show us your strength, O God, as you have done before.<DT>29 <DD>Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.<DT>30 <DD>Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.<DT>31 <DD>Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_8">8</a>]</sup>   will submit herself to God. <DT>32 <DD>Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, Selah<DT>33 <DD>to him who rides the ancient skies above, who thunders with mighty voice.<DT>34 <DD>Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies.<DT>35 <DD>You are awesome, O God, in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.  Praise be to God! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161036874_1">[4] Or  <I>prepare the way for him who rides through the deserts</I></A></LI>
