</DL><B>Job 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?<DT>2 <DD>Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.<DT>3 <DD>I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.<DT>4 <DD>His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.<DT>5 <DD>The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.<DT>6 <DD>For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.<DT>7 <DD>Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.<DT>9 <DD>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.<DT>10 <DD>He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.<DT>11 <DD>The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.<DT>12 <DD>He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.<DT>13 <DD>He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.<DT>14 <DD>Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.<DT>15 <DD>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.<DT>16 <DD>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth. <DT>17 <DD>&quot;Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.<DT>19 <DD>From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.<DT>20 <DD>In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.<DT>21 <DD>You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.<DT>22 <DD>You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.<DT>23 <DD>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.<DT>24 <DD>You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.<DT>25 <DD>You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.<DT>26 <DD>You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season. <DT>27 <DD>&quot;We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_111776534_1">[17] Hebrew <I>Shaddai</I>; here and throughout Job</A></LI>
