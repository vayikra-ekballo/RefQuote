</DL><B>1 Chronicles 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, &quot;We are your own flesh and blood.<DT>2 <DD>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, `You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'&quot;<DT>3 <DD>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.<DT>4 <DD>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there<DT>5 <DD>said to David, &quot;You will not get in here.&quot; Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.<DT>6 <DD>David had said, &quot;Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.&quot; Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.<DT>7 <DD>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.<DT>8 <DD>He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156295705_1">1</a>]</sup>   to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.<DT>9 <DD>And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.<DT>10 <DD>These were the chiefs of David's mighty men--they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised--<DT>11 <DD>this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156295705_2">2</a>]</sup>   a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156295705_3">3</a>]</sup>  ; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.<DT>12 <DD>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.<DT>13 <DD>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.<DT>14 <DD>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.<DT>15 <DD>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.<DT>16 <DD>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.<DT>17 <DD>David longed for water and said, &quot;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&quot;<DT>18 <DD>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.<DT>19 <DD>&quot;God forbid that I should do this!&quot; he said. &quot;Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?&quot; Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.<DT>20 <DD>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.<DT>21 <DD>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.<DT>22 <DD>Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.<DT>23 <DD>And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156295705_4">4</a>]</sup>   tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.<DT>24 <DD>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.<DT>25 <DD>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. <DT>26 <DD>The mighty men were: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,<DT>27 <DD>Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,<DT>28 <DD>Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, Abiezer from Anathoth,<DT>29 <DD>Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,<DT>30 <DD>Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,<DT>31 <DD>Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,<DT>32 <DD>Hurai from the ravines of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,<DT>33 <DD>Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,<DT>34 <DD>the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,<DT>35 <DD>Ahiam son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,<DT>36 <DD>Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,<DT>37 <DD>Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,<DT>38 <DD>Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,<DT>39 <DD>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,<DT>40 <DD>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,<DT>41 <DD>Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,<DT>42 <DD>Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, who was chief of the Reubenites, and the thirty with him,<DT>43 <DD>Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,<DT>44 <DD>Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,<DT>45 <DD>Jediael son of Shimri, his brother Joha the Tizite,<DT>46 <DD>Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,<DT>47 <DD>Eliel, Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_156295705_1">[8] Or <I>the Millo</I></A></LI>
