</DL><B>Galatians 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--<DT>2 <DD>and all the brothers with me,  To the churches in Galatia: <DT>3 <DD>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,<DT>4 <DD>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,<DT>5 <DD>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <DT>6 <DD>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--<DT>7 <DD>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.<DT>8 <DD>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!<DT>9 <DD>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!<DT>10 <DD>Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.<DT>11 <DD>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.<DT>12 <DD>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<DT>13 <DD>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.<DT>14 <DD>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.<DT>15 <DD>But when God, who set me apart from birth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup>   and called me by his grace, was pleased<DT>16 <DD>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,<DT>17 <DD>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.<DT>18 <DD>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_2">2</a>]</sup>   and stayed with him fifteen days.<DT>19 <DD>I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.<DT>20 <DD>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.<DT>21 <DD>Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.<DT>22 <DD>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.<DT>23 <DD>They only heard the report: &quot;The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>And they praised God because of me.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_123880395_1">[15] Or <I>from my mother's womb</I></A></LI>
