</DL><B>Psalm 84</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 84  For the director of music. According to gittith. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup>   Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty!<DT>2 <DD>My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. <DT>3 <DD>Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young-- a place near your altar, O LORD Almighty, my King and my God.<DT>4 <DD>Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. Selah <DT>5 <DD>Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.<DT>6 <DD>As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. <DT>8 <DD>Hear my prayer, O LORD God Almighty; listen to me, O God of Jacob. Selah<DT>9 <DD>Look upon our shield, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup>   O God; look with favor on your anointed one. <DT>10 <DD>Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.<DT>11 <DD>For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. <DT>12 <DD>O LORD Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102876638_1">[Title: Probably a musical term</A></LI>
