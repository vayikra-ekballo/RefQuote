</DL><B>Hosea 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Say of your brothers, `My people,' and of your sisters, `My loved one.'<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.<DT>3 <DD>Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst.<DT>4 <DD>I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery.<DT>5 <DD>Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, `I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'<DT>6 <DD>Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.<DT>7 <DD>She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, `I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.'<DT>8 <DD>She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold-- which they used for Baal. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her nakedness.<DT>10 <DD>So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.<DT>11 <DD>I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days--all her appointed feasts.<DT>12 <DD>I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them.<DT>13 <DD>I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot,&quot;  declares the LORD. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her.<DT>15 <DD>There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_1">1</a>]</sup>   a door of hope. There she will sing <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_2">2</a>]</sup>   as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;In that day,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;you will call me `my husband'; you will no longer call me `my master. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_3">3</a>]</sup>  '<DT>17 <DD>I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.<DT>18 <DD>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety.<DT>19 <DD>I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_4">4</a>]</sup>   righteousness and justice, in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_5">5</a>]</sup>   love and compassion.<DT>20 <DD>I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;In that day I will respond,&quot; declares the LORD-- &quot;I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;<DT>22 <DD>and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_6">6</a>]</sup>  <DT>23 <DD>I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called `Not my loved one. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_7">7</a>]</sup>  ' I will say to those called `Not my people, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_8">8</a>]</sup>  ' `You are my people'; and they will say, `You are my God.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_182944417_1">[15] <I>Achor</I> means <I>trouble.</I></A></LI>
