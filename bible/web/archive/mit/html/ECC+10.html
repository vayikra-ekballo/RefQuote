</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.<DT>2 <DD>The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.<DT>3 <DD>Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.<DT>4 <DD>If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest. <DT>5 <DD>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler:<DT>6 <DD>Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.<DT>7 <DD>I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. <DT>8 <DD>Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.<DT>9 <DD>Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. <DT>10 <DD>If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success. <DT>11 <DD>If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer. <DT>12 <DD>Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.<DT>13 <DD>At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness--<DT>14 <DD>and the fool multiplies words.  No one knows what is coming-- who can tell him what will happen after him? <DT>15 <DD>A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town. <DT>16 <DD>Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup>   and whose princes feast in the morning.<DT>17 <DD>Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time-- for strength and not for drunkenness. <DT>18 <DD>If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks. <DT>19 <DD>A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything. <DT>20 <DD>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_123880395_1">[16] Or <I>king is a child</I></A></LI>
