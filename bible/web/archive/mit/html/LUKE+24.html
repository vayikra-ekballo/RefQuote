</DL><B>Luke 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.<DT>2 <DD>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,<DT>3 <DD>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<DT>4 <DD>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.<DT>5 <DD>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &quot;Why do you look for the living among the dead?<DT>6 <DD>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:<DT>7 <DD>`The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Then they remembered his words.<DT>9 <DD>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.<DT>10 <DD>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.<DT>11 <DD>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.<DT>12 <DD>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.<DT>13 <DD>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles <sup>[<a href="#footnote_194399283_1">1</a>]</sup>   from Jerusalem.<DT>14 <DD>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.<DT>15 <DD>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;<DT>16 <DD>but they were kept from recognizing him.<DT>17 <DD>He asked them, &quot;What are you discussing together as you walk along?&quot; They stood still, their faces downcast.<DT>18 <DD>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, &quot;Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?&quot;<DT>19 <DD>&quot;What things?&quot; he asked. &quot;About Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; they replied. &quot;He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.<DT>20 <DD>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;<DT>21 <DD>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.<DT>22 <DD>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning<DT>23 <DD>but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.<DT>24 <DD>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>He said to them, &quot;How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!<DT>26 <DD>Did not the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_194399283_2">2</a>]</sup>   have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?&quot;<DT>27 <DD>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.<DT>28 <DD>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.<DT>29 <DD>But they urged him strongly, &quot;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.&quot; So he went in to stay with them.<DT>30 <DD>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.<DT>31 <DD>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.<DT>32 <DD>They asked each other, &quot;Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?&quot;<DT>33 <DD>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together<DT>34 <DD>and saying, &quot;It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.&quot;<DT>35 <DD>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.<DT>36 <DD>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot;<DT>37 <DD>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.<DT>38 <DD>He said to them, &quot;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?<DT>39 <DD>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.&quot;<DT>40 <DD>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.<DT>41 <DD>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, &quot;Do you have anything here to eat?&quot;<DT>42 <DD>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,<DT>43 <DD>and he took it and ate it in their presence.<DT>44 <DD>He said to them, &quot;This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.&quot;<DT>45 <DD>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.<DT>46 <DD>He told them, &quot;This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,<DT>47 <DD>and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<DT>48 <DD>You are witnesses of these things.<DT>49 <DD>I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&quot;<DT>50 <DD>When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.<DT>51 <DD>While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.<DT>52 <DD>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.<DT>53 <DD>And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_194399283_1">[13] Greek <I>sixty stadia</I> (about 11 kilometers)</A></LI>
