</DL><B>Ezekiel 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_1">1</a>]</sup>   thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.<DT>2 <DD>On the fifth of the month--it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin--<DT>3 <DD>the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_2">2</a>]</sup>   by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_3">3</a>]</sup>   There the hand of the LORD was upon him.<DT>4 <DD>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north--an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,<DT>5 <DD>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man,<DT>6 <DD>but each of them had four faces and four wings.<DT>7 <DD>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.<DT>8 <DD>Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings,<DT>9 <DD>and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.<DT>10 <DD>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.<DT>11 <DD>Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.<DT>12 <DD>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.<DT>13 <DD>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.<DT>14 <DD>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.<DT>15 <DD>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.<DT>16 <DD>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.<DT>17 <DD>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_4">4</a>]</sup>   as the creatures went.<DT>18 <DD>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.<DT>19 <DD>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.<DT>20 <DD>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.<DT>21 <DD>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.<DT>22 <DD>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome.<DT>23 <DD>Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.<DT>24 <DD>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_5">5</a>]</sup>   like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.<DT>25 <DD>Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.<DT>26 <DD>Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_6">6</a>]</sup>   and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.<DT>27 <DD>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.<DT>28 <DD>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_134516985_1">[1] Or <I>[my]</I></A></LI>
