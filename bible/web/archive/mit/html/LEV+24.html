</DL><B>Leviticus 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.<DT>3 <DD>Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.<DT>4 <DD>The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   for each loaf.<DT>6 <DD>Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the LORD by fire.<DT>8 <DD>This bread is to be set out before the LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.<DT>9 <DD>It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.<DT>11 <DD>The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)<DT>12 <DD>They put him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.<DT>13 <DD>Then the LORD said to Moses:<DT>14 <DD>&quot;Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.<DT>15 <DD>Say to the Israelites: `If anyone curses his God, he will be held responsible;<DT>16 <DD>anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;`If anyone takes the life of a human being, he must be put to death.<DT>18 <DD>Anyone who takes the life of someone's animal must make restitution--life for life.<DT>19 <DD>If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:<DT>20 <DD>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other, so he is to be injured.<DT>21 <DD>Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.<DT>22 <DD>You are to have the same law for the alien and the native-born. I am the LORD your God.'&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[5] That is, probably about 4 quarts (about 4.5 liters)</A></LI>
