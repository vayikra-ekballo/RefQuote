</DL><B>Psalm 50</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 50  A psalm of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets.<DT>2 <DD>From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.<DT>3 <DD>Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.<DT>4 <DD>He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:<DT>5 <DD>&quot;Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.<DT>8 <DD>I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.<DT>9 <DD>I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,<DT>10 <DD>for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.<DT>11 <DD>I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine.<DT>12 <DD>If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.<DT>13 <DD>Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?<DT>14 <DD>Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,<DT>15 <DD>and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>But to the wicked, God says: &quot;What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?<DT>17 <DD>You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.<DT>18 <DD>When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.<DT>19 <DD>You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.<DT>20 <DD>You speak continually against your brother and slander your own mother's son.<DT>21 <DD>These things you have done and I kept silent; you thought I was altogether <sup>[<a href="#footnote_170415707_1">1</a>]</sup>   like you. But I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face. <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue:<DT>23 <DD>He who sacrifices thank offerings honors me, and he prepares the way so that I may show him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_170415707_2">2</a>]</sup>   the salvation of God.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_170415707_1">[21] Or <I>thought the `I AM' was</I></A></LI>
