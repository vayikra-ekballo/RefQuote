</DL><B>Psalm 140</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 140  For the director of music. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; protect me from men of violence,<DT>2 <DD>who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.<DT>3 <DD>They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah <DT>4 <DD>Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from men of violence who plan to trip my feet.<DT>5 <DD>Proud men have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. Selah <DT>6 <DD>O LORD, I say to you, &quot;You are my God.&quot; Hear, O LORD, my cry for mercy.<DT>7 <DD>O Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, who shields my head in the day of battle--<DT>8 <DD>do not grant the wicked their desires, O LORD; do not let their plans succeed, or they will become proud.  Selah <DT>9 <DD>Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused.<DT>10 <DD>Let burning coals fall upon them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.<DT>11 <DD>Let slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down men of violence. <DT>12 <DD>I know that the LORD secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy.<DT>13 <DD>Surely the righteous will praise your name and the upright will live before you. </DL><OL></OL>
