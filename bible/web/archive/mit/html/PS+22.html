</DL><B>Psalm 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 22  For the director of music. To [the tune of] &quot;The Doe of the Morning.&quot; A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning?<DT>2 <DD>O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent. <DT>3 <DD>Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.<DT>5 <DD>They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed. <DT>6 <DD>But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.<DT>7 <DD>All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:<DT>8 <DD>&quot;He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast.<DT>10 <DD>From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God.<DT>11 <DD>Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. <DT>12 <DD>Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.<DT>13 <DD>Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me.<DT>14 <DD>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me.<DT>15 <DD>My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_2">2</a>]</sup>   in the dust of death.<DT>16 <DD>Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_3">3</a>]</sup>   my hands and my feet.<DT>17 <DD>I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me.<DT>18 <DD>They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. <DT>19 <DD>But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me.<DT>20 <DD>Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.<DT>21 <DD>Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_4">4</a>]</sup>   me from the horns of the wild oxen. <DT>22 <DD>I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you.<DT>23 <DD>You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!<DT>24 <DD>For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. <DT>25 <DD>From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_548790607_5">5</a>]</sup>   will I fulfill my vows.<DT>26 <DD>The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the LORD will praise him-- may your hearts live forever!<DT>27 <DD>All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him,<DT>28 <DD>for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations. <DT>29 <DD>All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him-- those who cannot keep themselves alive.<DT>30 <DD>Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord.<DT>31 <DD>They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn-- for he has done it. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_548790607_1">[3] Or <I>Yet you are holy,  enthroned on the praises of Israel</I></A></LI>
