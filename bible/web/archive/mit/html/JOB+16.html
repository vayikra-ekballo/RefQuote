</DL><B>Job 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!<DT>3 <DD>Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?<DT>4 <DD>I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.<DT>5 <DD>But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.<DT>7 <DD>Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.<DT>8 <DD>You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.<DT>9 <DD>God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.<DT>10 <DD>Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.<DT>11 <DD>God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.<DT>12 <DD>All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;<DT>13 <DD>his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.<DT>14 <DD>Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.<DT>16 <DD>My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;<DT>17 <DD>yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!<DT>19 <DD>Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.<DT>20 <DD>My intercessor is my friend<sup>[<a href="#footnote_207182871_1">1</a>]</sup>  as my eyes pour out tears to God;<DT>21 <DD>on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend. <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_207182871_1">[20] Or <I>My friends treat me with scorn</I></A></LI>
