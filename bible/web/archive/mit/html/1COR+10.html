</DL><B>1 Corinthians 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.<DT>2 <DD>They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.<DT>3 <DD>They all ate the same spiritual food<DT>4 <DD>and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.<DT>5 <DD>Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert.<DT>6 <DD>Now these things occurred as examples <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_1">1</a>]</sup>   to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.<DT>7 <DD>Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: &quot;The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.<DT>9 <DD>We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes.<DT>10 <DD>And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel.<DT>11 <DD>These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.<DT>12 <DD>So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!<DT>13 <DD>No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.<DT>14 <DD>Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.<DT>15 <DD>I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.<DT>16 <DD>Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?<DT>17 <DD>Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.<DT>18 <DD>Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?<DT>19 <DD>Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?<DT>20 <DD>No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.<DT>21 <DD>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons.<DT>22 <DD>Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?<DT>23 <DD>&quot;Everything is permissible&quot;--but not everything is beneficial. &quot;Everything is permissible&quot;--but not everything is constructive.<DT>24 <DD>Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others.<DT>25 <DD>Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,<DT>26 <DD>for, &quot;The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>27 <DD>If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.<DT>28 <DD>But if anyone says to you, &quot;This has been offered in sacrifice,&quot; then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_4">4</a>]</sup>  --<DT>29 <DD>the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?<DT>30 <DD>If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?<DT>31 <DD>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.<DT>32 <DD>Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God--<DT>33 <DD>even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115556033_1">[6] Or <I>types</I>; also in verse 11</A></LI>
