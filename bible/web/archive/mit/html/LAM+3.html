</DL><B>Lamentations 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_202814600_1">1</a>]</sup>    I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.<DT>2 <DD>He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;<DT>3 <DD>indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long. <DT>4 <DD>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.<DT>5 <DD>He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.<DT>6 <DD>He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead. <DT>7 <DD>He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.<DT>8 <DD>Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.<DT>9 <DD>He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked. <DT>10 <DD>Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,<DT>11 <DD>he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.<DT>12 <DD>He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows. <DT>13 <DD>He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.<DT>14 <DD>I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.<DT>15 <DD>He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall. <DT>16 <DD>He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.<DT>17 <DD>I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.<DT>18 <DD>So I say, &quot;My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD.&quot; <DT>19 <DD>I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.<DT>20 <DD>I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me.<DT>21 <DD>Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: <DT>22 <DD>Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.<DT>23 <DD>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.<DT>24 <DD>I say to myself, &quot;The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.&quot; <DT>25 <DD>The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;<DT>26 <DD>it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.<DT>27 <DD>It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young. <DT>28 <DD>Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him.<DT>29 <DD>Let him bury his face in the dust-- there may yet be hope.<DT>30 <DD>Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace. <DT>31 <DD>For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.<DT>32 <DD>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.<DT>33 <DD>For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men. <DT>34 <DD>To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,<DT>35 <DD>to deny a man his rights before the Most High,<DT>36 <DD>to deprive a man of justice-- would not the Lord see such things? <DT>37 <DD>Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?<DT>38 <DD>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?<DT>39 <DD>Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins? <DT>40 <DD>Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD.<DT>41 <DD>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:<DT>42 <DD>&quot;We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven. <DT>43 <DD>&quot;You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.<DT>44 <DD>You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.<DT>45 <DD>You have made us scum and refuse among the nations. <DT>46 <DD>&quot;All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.<DT>47 <DD>We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction.&quot;<DT>48 <DD>Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed. <DT>49 <DD>My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,<DT>50 <DD>until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.<DT>51 <DD>What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city. <DT>52 <DD>Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.<DT>53 <DD>They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;<DT>54 <DD>the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off. <DT>55 <DD>I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit.<DT>56 <DD>You heard my plea: &quot;Do not close your ears to my cry for relief.&quot;<DT>57 <DD>You came near when I called you, and you said, &quot;Do not fear.&quot; <DT>58 <DD>O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life.<DT>59 <DD>You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!<DT>60 <DD>You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me. <DT>61 <DD>O LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me--<DT>62 <DD>what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.<DT>63 <DD>Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs. <DT>64 <DD>Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.<DT>65 <DD>Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!<DT>66 <DD>Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_202814600_1">[This chapter is an acrostic poem; the verses of each stanza begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and the verses within each stanza begin with the same letter.</A></LI>
