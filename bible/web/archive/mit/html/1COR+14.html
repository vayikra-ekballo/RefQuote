</DL><B>1 Corinthians 14</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.<DT>2 <DD>For anyone who speaks in a tongue <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_1">1</a>]</sup>   does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.<DT>4 <DD>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.<DT>5 <DD>I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_3">3</a>]</sup>   but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_4">4</a>]</sup>   unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.<DT>6 <DD>Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?<DT>7 <DD>Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?<DT>8 <DD>Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?<DT>9 <DD>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.<DT>10 <DD>Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.<DT>11 <DD>If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.<DT>12 <DD>So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.<DT>13 <DD>For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.<DT>14 <DD>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.<DT>15 <DD>So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.<DT>16 <DD>If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_5">5</a>]</sup>   say &quot;Amen&quot; to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?<DT>17 <DD>You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.<DT>18 <DD>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.<DT>19 <DD>But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<DT>20 <DD>Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.<DT>21 <DD>In the Law it is written: &quot;Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_6">6</a>]</sup>   says the Lord.<DT>22 <DD>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.<DT>23 <DD>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_7">7</a>]</sup>   or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?<DT>24 <DD>But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_8">8</a>]</sup>   comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,<DT>25 <DD>and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, &quot;God is really among you!&quot;<DT>26 <DD>What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.<DT>27 <DD>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.<DT>28 <DD>If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.<DT>29 <DD>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.<DT>30 <DD>And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.<DT>31 <DD>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.<DT>32 <DD>The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.<DT>33 <DD>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,<DT>34 <DD>women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.<DT>35 <DD>If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.<DT>36 <DD>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?<DT>37 <DD>If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.<DT>38 <DD>If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_208779036_9">9</a>]</sup>  <DT>39 <DD>Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.<DT>40 <DD>But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_208779036_1">[2] Or <I>another language</I>; also in verses 4, 13, 14, 19, 26 and 27</A></LI>
