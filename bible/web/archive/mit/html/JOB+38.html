</DL><B>Job 38</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?<DT>3 <DD>Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.<DT>5 <DD>Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?<DT>6 <DD>On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone--<DT>7 <DD>while the morning stars sang together and all the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_1">1</a>]</sup>   shouted for joy? <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,<DT>9 <DD>when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,<DT>10 <DD>when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,<DT>11 <DD>when I said, `This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'? <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,<DT>13 <DD>that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?<DT>14 <DD>The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.<DT>15 <DD>The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?<DT>17 <DD>Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_2">2</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>18 <DD>Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this. <DT>19 <DD>&quot;What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?<DT>20 <DD>Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?<DT>21 <DD>Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years! <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,<DT>23 <DD>which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?<DT>24 <DD>What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?<DT>25 <DD>Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,<DT>26 <DD>to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,<DT>27 <DD>to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?<DT>28 <DD>Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?<DT>29 <DD>From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens<DT>30 <DD>when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen? <DT>31 <DD>&quot;Can you bind the beautiful <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_3">3</a>]</sup>   Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?<DT>32 <DD>Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_4">4</a>]</sup>   or lead out the Bear <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_5">5</a>]</sup>   with its cubs?<DT>33 <DD>Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up [God's <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_6">6</a>]</sup>  ] dominion over the earth? <DT>34 <DD>&quot;Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?<DT>35 <DD>Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, `Here we are'?<DT>36 <DD>Who endowed the heart <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_7">7</a>]</sup>   with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181794720_8">8</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>37 <DD>Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens<DT>38 <DD>when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together? <DT>39 <DD>&quot;Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions<DT>40 <DD>when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?<DT>41 <DD>Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food? </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_181794720_1">[7] Hebrew <I>the sons of God</I></A></LI>
