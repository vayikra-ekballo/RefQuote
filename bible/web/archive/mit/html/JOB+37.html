</DL><B>Job 37</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.<DT>2 <DD>Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.<DT>3 <DD>He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.<DT>4 <DD>After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.<DT>5 <DD>God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.<DT>6 <DD>He says to the snow, `Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, `Be a mighty downpour.'<DT>7 <DD>So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.<DT>9 <DD>The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.<DT>10 <DD>The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.<DT>11 <DD>He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.<DT>12 <DD>At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.<DT>13 <DD>He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_2">2</a>]</sup>   and show his love. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.<DT>15 <DD>Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?<DT>16 <DD>Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?<DT>17 <DD>You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,<DT>18 <DD>can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? <DT>19 <DD>&quot;Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.<DT>20 <DD>Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?<DT>21 <DD>Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.<DT>22 <DD>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.<DT>23 <DD>The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.<DT>24 <DD>Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_3">3</a>]</sup>  &quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_212887290_1">[7] Or  <I>he fills all men with fear by his power</I></A></LI>
