</DL><B>Psalm 115</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 115 <DT>1 <DD>Not to us, O LORD, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness. <DT>2 <DD>Why do the nations say, &quot;Where is their God?&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.<DT>4 <DD>But their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.<DT>5 <DD>They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see;<DT>6 <DD>they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell;<DT>7 <DD>they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats.<DT>8 <DD>Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them. <DT>9 <DD>O house of Israel, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield.<DT>10 <DD>O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield.<DT>11 <DD>You who fear him, trust in the LORD-- he is their help and shield. <DT>12 <DD>The LORD remembers us and will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,<DT>13 <DD>he will bless those who fear the LORD-- small and great alike. <DT>14 <DD>May the LORD make you increase, both you and your children.<DT>15 <DD>May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. <DT>16 <DD>The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to man.<DT>17 <DD>It is not the dead who praise the LORD, those who go down to silence;<DT>18 <DD>it is we who extol the LORD, both now and forevermore.  Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_192599806_1">1</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_192599806_1">[18] Hebrew <I>Hallelu Yah</I></A></LI>
