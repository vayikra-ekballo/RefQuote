</DL><B>Psalm 143</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 143  A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>O LORD, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.<DT>2 <DD>Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you. <DT>3 <DD>The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.<DT>4 <DD>So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed. <DT>5 <DD>I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.<DT>6 <DD>I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah <DT>7 <DD>Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.<DT>8 <DD>Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.<DT>9 <DD>Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD, for I hide myself in you.<DT>10 <DD>Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground. <DT>11 <DD>For your name's sake, O LORD, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.<DT>12 <DD>In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant. </DL><OL></OL>
