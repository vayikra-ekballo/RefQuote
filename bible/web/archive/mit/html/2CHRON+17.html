</DL><B>2 Chronicles 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.<DT>2 <DD>He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.<DT>3 <DD>The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals<DT>4 <DD>but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.<DT>5 <DD>The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.<DT>6 <DD>His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.<DT>7 <DD>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.<DT>8 <DD>With them were certain Levites--Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah--and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.<DT>9 <DD>They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.<DT>10 <DD>The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.<DT>11 <DD>Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.<DT>12 <DD>Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah<DT>13 <DD>and had large supplies in the towns of Judah.
