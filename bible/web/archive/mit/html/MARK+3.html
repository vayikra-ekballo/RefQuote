</DL><B>Mark 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.<DT>2 <DD>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.<DT>3 <DD>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, &quot;Stand up in front of everyone.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Then Jesus asked them, &quot;Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?&quot; But they remained silent.<DT>5 <DD>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.<DT>6 <DD>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.<DT>7 <DD>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.<DT>8 <DD>When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.<DT>9 <DD>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.<DT>10 <DD>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.<DT>11 <DD>Whenever the evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_1">1</a>]</sup>   spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, &quot;You are the Son of God.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.<DT>13 <DD>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.<DT>14 <DD>He appointed twelve--designating them apostles <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_2">2</a>]</sup>  --that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach<DT>15 <DD>and to have authority to drive out demons.<DT>16 <DD>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);<DT>17 <DD>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);<DT>18 <DD>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot<DT>19 <DD>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.<DT>20 <DD>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.<DT>21 <DD>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, &quot;He is out of his mind.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, &quot;He is possessed by Beelzebub <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_3">3</a>]</sup>  ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: &quot;How can Satan drive out Satan?<DT>24 <DD>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<DT>25 <DD>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.<DT>26 <DD>And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.<DT>27 <DD>In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.<DT>28 <DD>I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.<DT>29 <DD>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>He said this because they were saying, &quot;He has an evil spirit.&quot;<DT>31 <DD>Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.<DT>32 <DD>A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, &quot;Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>&quot;Who are my mother and my brothers?&quot; he asked.<DT>34 <DD>Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, &quot;Here are my mother and my brothers!<DT>35 <DD>Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_892662446_1">[11] Greek <I>unclean</I>; also in verse 30</A></LI>
