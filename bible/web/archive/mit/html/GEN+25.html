</DL><B>Genesis 25</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Abraham took <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup>   another wife, whose name was Keturah.<DT>2 <DD>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.<DT>3 <DD>Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.<DT>4 <DD>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.<DT>5 <DD>Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.<DT>6 <DD>But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.<DT>7 <DD>Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.<DT>8 <DD>Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.<DT>9 <DD>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,<DT>10 <DD>the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_2">2</a>]</sup>   There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.<DT>11 <DD>After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi. <DT>12 <DD>This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham. <DT>13 <DD>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,<DT>14 <DD>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,<DT>15 <DD>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.<DT>16 <DD>These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.<DT>17 <DD>Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.<DT>18 <DD>His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_3">3</a>]</sup>   all their brothers. <DT>19 <DD>This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac.  Abraham became the father of Isaac,<DT>20 <DD>and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_4">4</a>]</sup>   and sister of Laban the Aramean.<DT>21 <DD>Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.<DT>22 <DD>The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot; So she went to inquire of the LORD.<DT>23 <DD>The LORD said to her, &quot;Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.<DT>25 <DD>The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>26 <DD>After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_6">6</a>]</sup>   Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.<DT>27 <DD>The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.<DT>28 <DD>Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.<DT>29 <DD>Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.<DT>30 <DD>He said to Jacob, &quot;Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!&quot; (That is why he was also called Edom. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_7">7</a>]</sup>  )<DT>31 <DD>Jacob replied, &quot;First sell me your birthright.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>&quot;Look, I am about to die,&quot; Esau said. &quot;What good is the birthright to me?&quot;<DT>33 <DD>But Jacob said, &quot;Swear to me first.&quot; So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.<DT>34 <DD>Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_717090538_1">[1] Or <I>had taken</I></A></LI>
