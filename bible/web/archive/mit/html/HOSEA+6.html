</DL><B>Hosea 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds.<DT>2 <DD>After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.<DT>3 <DD>Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.&quot; <DT>4 <DD>&quot;What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.<DT>5 <DD>Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth; my judgments flashed like lightning upon you.<DT>6 <DD>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.<DT>7 <DD>Like Adam, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_168623424_1">1</a>]</sup>   they have broken the covenant-- they were unfaithful to me there.<DT>8 <DD>Gilead is a city of wicked men, stained with footprints of blood.<DT>9 <DD>As marauders lie in ambush for a man, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.<DT>10 <DD>I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_168623424_1">[7] Or <I>As at Adam</I>; or <I>Like men</I></A></LI>
