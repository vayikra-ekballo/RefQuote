</DL><B>Job 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.<DT>2 <DD>Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?<DT>4 <DD>You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.<DT>5 <DD>If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.<DT>7 <DD>My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.<DT>8 <DD>Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.<DT>9 <DD>Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.<DT>11 <DD>My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.<DT>12 <DD>These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, `Light is near.'<DT>13 <DD>If the only home I hope for is the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_1">1</a>]</sup>   if I spread out my bed in darkness,<DT>14 <DD>if I say to corruption, `You are my father,' and to the worm, `My mother' or `My sister,'<DT>15 <DD>where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?<DT>16 <DD>Will it go down to the gates of death <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_2">2</a>]</sup>  ? Will we descend together into the dust?&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_690230324_1">[13] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
