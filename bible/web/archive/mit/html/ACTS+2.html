</DL><B>Acts 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.<DT>2 <DD>Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.<DT>3 <DD>They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.<DT>4 <DD>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_1">1</a>]</sup>   as the Spirit enabled them.<DT>5 <DD>Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.<DT>6 <DD>When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.<DT>7 <DD>Utterly amazed, they asked: &quot;Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?<DT>8 <DD>Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?<DT>9 <DD>Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,<DT>10 <DD>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome<DT>11 <DD>(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, &quot;What does this mean?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Some, however, made fun of them and said, &quot;They have had too much wine. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_2">2</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>14 <DD>Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: &quot;Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.<DT>15 <DD>These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!<DT>16 <DD>No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:<DT>17 <DD>&quot;`In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.<DT>18 <DD>Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.<DT>19 <DD>I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.<DT>20 <DD>The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.<DT>21 <DD>And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>22 <DD>&quot;Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.<DT>23 <DD>This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_4">4</a>]</sup>   put him to death by nailing him to the cross.<DT>24 <DD>But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.<DT>25 <DD>David said about him: &quot;`I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.<DT>26 <DD>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope,<DT>27 <DD>because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.<DT>28 <DD>You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>29 <DD>&quot;Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.<DT>30 <DD>But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.<DT>31 <DD>Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_6">6</a>]</sup>   that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.<DT>32 <DD>God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.<DT>33 <DD>Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.<DT>34 <DD>For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, &quot;`The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand<DT>35 <DD>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&quot;' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_7">7</a>]</sup>  <DT>36 <DD>&quot;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot;<DT>37 <DD>When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, &quot;Brothers, what shall we do?&quot;<DT>38 <DD>Peter replied, &quot;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<DT>39 <DD>The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.&quot;<DT>40 <DD>With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, &quot;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&quot;<DT>41 <DD>Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.<DT>42 <DD>They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.<DT>43 <DD>Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.<DT>44 <DD>All the believers were together and had everything in common.<DT>45 <DD>Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.<DT>46 <DD>Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,<DT>47 <DD>praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_125000557_1">[4] Or <I>languages</I>; also in verse 11</A></LI>
