</DL><B>2 Corinthians 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.<DT>2 <DD>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.<DT>3 <DD>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.<DT>4 <DD>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.<DT>5 <DD>But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those &quot;super-apostles.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.<DT>7 <DD>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?<DT>8 <DD>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.<DT>9 <DD>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.<DT>10 <DD>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.<DT>11 <DD>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!<DT>12 <DD>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.<DT>13 <DD>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.<DT>14 <DD>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.<DT>15 <DD>It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<DT>16 <DD>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.<DT>17 <DD>In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.<DT>18 <DD>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.<DT>19 <DD>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!<DT>20 <DD>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.<DT>21 <DD>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about.<DT>22 <DD>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.<DT>23 <DD>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.<DT>24 <DD>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.<DT>25 <DD>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,<DT>26 <DD>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.<DT>27 <DD>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.<DT>28 <DD>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.<DT>29 <DD>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?<DT>30 <DD>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.<DT>31 <DD>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.<DT>32 <DD>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.<DT>33 <DD>But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.</DL><OL></OL>
