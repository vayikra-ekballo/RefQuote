</DL><B>Job 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?<DT>3 <DD>Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.<DT>4 <DD>Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.<DT>5 <DD>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.<DT>6 <DD>Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope? <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?<DT>8 <DD>As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.<DT>9 <DD>At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.<DT>10 <DD>The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.<DT>11 <DD>The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.<DT>13 <DD>Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,<DT>14 <DD>fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.<DT>15 <DD>A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.<DT>16 <DD>It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice:<DT>17 <DD>`Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?<DT>18 <DD>If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,<DT>19 <DD>how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!<DT>20 <DD>Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.<DT>21 <DD>Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'<sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_1">1</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_142197556_1">[21] Some interpreters end the quotation after verse 17.</A></LI>
