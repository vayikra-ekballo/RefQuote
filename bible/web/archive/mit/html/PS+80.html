</DL><B>Psalm 80</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 80  For the director of music. To [the tune of] &quot;The Lilies of the Covenant.&quot; Of Asaph. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock; you who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth<DT>2 <DD>before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us. <DT>3 <DD>Restore us, O God; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. <DT>4 <DD>O LORD God Almighty, how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?<DT>5 <DD>You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.<DT>6 <DD>You have made us a source of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us. <DT>7 <DD>Restore us, O God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. <DT>8 <DD>You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.<DT>9 <DD>You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.<DT>10 <DD>The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.<DT>11 <DD>It sent out its boughs to the Sea, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_1">1</a>]</sup>   its shoots as far as the River. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>12 <DD>Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?<DT>13 <DD>Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it.<DT>14 <DD>Return to us, O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,<DT>15 <DD>the root your right hand has planted, the son <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117192532_3">3</a>]</sup>   you have raised up for yourself. <DT>16 <DD>Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.<DT>17 <DD>Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.<DT>18 <DD>Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name. <DT>19 <DD>Restore us, O LORD God Almighty; make your face shine upon us, that we may be saved. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_117192532_1">[11] Probably the Mediterranean</A></LI>
