</DL><B>Proverbs 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.<DT>2 <DD>Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.<DT>3 <DD>Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.<DT>4 <DD>Say to wisdom, &quot;You are my sister,&quot; and call understanding your kinsman;<DT>5 <DD>they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words. <DT>6 <DD>At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.<DT>7 <DD>I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.<DT>8 <DD>He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house<DT>9 <DD>at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in. <DT>10 <DD>Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.<DT>11 <DD>(She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;<DT>12 <DD>now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)<DT>13 <DD>She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: <DT>14 <DD>&quot;I have fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_1">1</a>]</sup>   at home; today I fulfilled my vows.<DT>15 <DD>So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!<DT>16 <DD>I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.<DT>17 <DD>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.<DT>18 <DD>Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!<DT>19 <DD>My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.<DT>20 <DD>He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.&quot; <DT>21 <DD>With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.<DT>22 <DD>All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_2">2</a>]</sup>   stepping into a noose <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>23 <DD>till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. <DT>24 <DD>Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.<DT>25 <DD>Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.<DT>26 <DD>Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.<DT>27 <DD>Her house is a highway to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190323031_4">4</a>]</sup>   leading down to the chambers of death. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_190323031_1">[14] Traditionally <I>peace offerings</I></A></LI>
