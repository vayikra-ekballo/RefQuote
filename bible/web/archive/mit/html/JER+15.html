</DL><B>Jeremiah 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the LORD said to me: &quot;Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!<DT>2 <DD>And if they ask you, `Where shall we go?' tell them, `This is what the LORD says: &quot;`Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.'<DT>3 <DD>&quot;I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.<DT>4 <DD>I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are?<DT>6 <DD>You have rejected me,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;You keep on backsliding. So I will lay hands on you and destroy you; I can no longer show compassion.<DT>7 <DD>I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people, for they have not changed their ways.<DT>8 <DD>I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men; suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror.<DT>9 <DD>The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies,&quot;  declares the LORD. <DT>10 <DD>Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me.<DT>11 <DD>The LORD said, &quot;Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Can a man break iron-- iron from the north--or bronze?<DT>13 <DD>Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country.<DT>14 <DD>I will enslave you to your enemies in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161676293_1">1</a>]</sup>   a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.&quot; <DT>15 <DD>You understand, O LORD; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering--do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.<DT>16 <DD>When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight, for I bear your name, O LORD God Almighty.<DT>17 <DD>I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation.<DT>18 <DD>Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails?<DT>19 <DD>Therefore this is what the LORD says: &quot;If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them.<DT>20 <DD>I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;I will save you from the hands of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161676293_1">[14] Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint and Syriac (see also Jer. 17:4); most Hebrew manuscripts <I>I will cause your enemies to bring you / into</I></A></LI>
