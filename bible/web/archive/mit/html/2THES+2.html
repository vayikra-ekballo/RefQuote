</DL><B>2 Thessalonians 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,<DT>2 <DD>not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.<DT>3 <DD>Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_1">1</a>]</sup>   is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.<DT>4 <DD>He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.<DT>5 <DD>Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?<DT>6 <DD>And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.<DT>7 <DD>For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.<DT>8 <DD>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.<DT>9 <DD>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,<DT>10 <DD>and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.<DT>11 <DD>For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie<DT>12 <DD>and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.<DT>13 <DD>But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_2">2</a>]</sup>   to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.<DT>14 <DD>He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<DT>15 <DD>So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_3">3</a>]</sup>   we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.<DT>16 <DD>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,<DT>17 <DD>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_587762005_1">[3] Some manuscripts <I>sin</I></A></LI>
