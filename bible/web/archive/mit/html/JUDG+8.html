</DL><B>Judges 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, &quot;Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?&quot; And they criticized him sharply.<DT>2 <DD>But he answered them, &quot;What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?<DT>3 <DD>God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?&quot; At this, their resentment against him subsided.<DT>4 <DD>Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.<DT>5 <DD>He said to the men of Succoth, &quot;Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>But the officials of Succoth said, &quot;Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?&quot;<DT>7 <DD>Then Gideon replied, &quot;Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>From there he went up to Peniel <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_1">1</a>]</sup>   and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had.<DT>9 <DD>So he said to the men of Peniel, &quot;When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.<DT>11 <DD>Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army.<DT>12 <DD>Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.<DT>13 <DD>Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.<DT>14 <DD>He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the elders of the town.<DT>15 <DD>Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, &quot;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, `Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'&quot;<DT>16 <DD>He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.<DT>17 <DD>He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.<DT>18 <DD>Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, &quot;What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?&quot; &quot;Men like you,&quot; they answered, &quot;each one with the bearing of a prince.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>Gideon replied, &quot;Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, &quot;Kill them!&quot; But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.<DT>21 <DD>Zebah and Zalmunna said, &quot;Come, do it yourself. `As is the man, so is his strength.'&quot; So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks.<DT>22 <DD>The Israelites said to Gideon, &quot;Rule over us--you, your son and your grandson--because you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>But Gideon told them, &quot;I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>And he said, &quot;I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.&quot; (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)<DT>25 <DD>They answered, &quot;We'll be glad to give them.&quot; So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it.<DT>26 <DD>The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_181955953_2">2</a>]</sup>   not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks.<DT>27 <DD>Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.<DT>28 <DD>Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.<DT>29 <DD>Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.<DT>30 <DD>He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.<DT>31 <DD>His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.<DT>32 <DD>Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.<DT>33 <DD>No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god and<DT>34 <DD>did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.<DT>35 <DD>They also failed to show kindness to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for them.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_181955953_1">[8] Hebrew <I>Penuel,</I> a variant of <I>Peniel</I>; also in verses 9 and 17</A></LI>
