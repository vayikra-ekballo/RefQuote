</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men:<DT>2 <DD>God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.<DT>3 <DD>A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.<DT>4 <DD>It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.<DT>5 <DD>Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man--<DT>6 <DD>even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?<DT>7 <DD>All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.<DT>8 <DD>What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?<DT>9 <DD>Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. <DT>10 <DD>Whatever exists has already been named, and what man is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than he.<DT>11 <DD>The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?<DT>12 <DD>For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?</DL><OL></OL>
