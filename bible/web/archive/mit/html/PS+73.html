</DL><B>Psalm 73</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 73  A psalm of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. <DT>2 <DD>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.<DT>3 <DD>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <DT>4 <DD>They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.<DT>6 <DD>Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.<DT>7 <DD>From their callous hearts comes iniquity <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.<DT>8 <DD>They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.<DT>9 <DD>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.<DT>10 <DD>Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>11 <DD>They say, &quot;How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?&quot; <DT>12 <DD>This is what the wicked are like-- always carefree, they increase in wealth. <DT>13 <DD>Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.<DT>14 <DD>All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning. <DT>15 <DD>If I had said, &quot;I will speak thus,&quot; I would have betrayed your children.<DT>16 <DD>When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me<DT>17 <DD>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny. <DT>18 <DD>Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.<DT>19 <DD>How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!<DT>20 <DD>As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies. <DT>21 <DD>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,<DT>22 <DD>I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. <DT>23 <DD>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.<DT>24 <DD>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.<DT>25 <DD>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.<DT>26 <DD>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <DT>27 <DD>Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.<DT>28 <DD>But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115870484_1">[4] With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text <I>struggles at their death;  their bodies are healthy</I></A></LI>
