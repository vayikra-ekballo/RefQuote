</DL><B>Psalm 78</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 78  A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_717090538_1">1</a>]</sup>   of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.<DT>2 <DD>I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--<DT>3 <DD>what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.<DT>4 <DD>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.<DT>5 <DD>He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,<DT>6 <DD>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.<DT>7 <DD>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.<DT>8 <DD>They would not be like their forefathers-- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. <DT>9 <DD>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;<DT>10 <DD>they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.<DT>11 <DD>They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.<DT>12 <DD>He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.<DT>13 <DD>He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.<DT>14 <DD>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.<DT>15 <DD>He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;<DT>16 <DD>he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. <DT>17 <DD>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.<DT>18 <DD>They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.<DT>19 <DD>They spoke against God, saying, &quot;Can God spread a table in the desert?<DT>20 <DD>When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?&quot;<DT>21 <DD>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,<DT>22 <DD>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.<DT>23 <DD>Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;<DT>24 <DD>he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.<DT>25 <DD>Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.<DT>26 <DD>He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.<DT>27 <DD>He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.<DT>28 <DD>He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.<DT>29 <DD>They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.<DT>30 <DD>But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,<DT>31 <DD>God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. <DT>32 <DD>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.<DT>33 <DD>So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.<DT>34 <DD>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.<DT>35 <DD>They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.<DT>36 <DD>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;<DT>37 <DD>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.<DT>38 <DD>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.<DT>39 <DD>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. <DT>40 <DD>How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!<DT>41 <DD>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.<DT>42 <DD>They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,<DT>43 <DD>the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.<DT>44 <DD>He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.<DT>45 <DD>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.<DT>46 <DD>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.<DT>47 <DD>He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.<DT>48 <DD>He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.<DT>49 <DD>He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.<DT>50 <DD>He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.<DT>51 <DD>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.<DT>52 <DD>But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.<DT>53 <DD>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.<DT>54 <DD>Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.<DT>55 <DD>He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. <DT>56 <DD>But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.<DT>57 <DD>Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.<DT>58 <DD>They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.<DT>59 <DD>When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.<DT>60 <DD>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.<DT>61 <DD>He sent [the ark of] his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.<DT>62 <DD>He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.<DT>63 <DD>Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;<DT>64 <DD>their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. <DT>65 <DD>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.<DT>66 <DD>He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.<DT>67 <DD>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;<DT>68 <DD>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.<DT>69 <DD>He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.<DT>70 <DD>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;<DT>71 <DD>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.<DT>72 <DD>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_717090538_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
