</DL><B>Proverbs 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the reply of the tongue. <DT>2 <DD>All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the LORD. <DT>3 <DD>Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed. <DT>4 <DD>The LORD works out everything for his own ends-- even the wicked for a day of disaster. <DT>5 <DD>The LORD detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished. <DT>6 <DD>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the LORD a man avoids evil. <DT>7 <DD>When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him. <DT>8 <DD>Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice. <DT>9 <DD>In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps. <DT>10 <DD>The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth should not betray justice. <DT>11 <DD>Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are of his making. <DT>12 <DD>Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne is established through righteousness. <DT>13 <DD>Kings take pleasure in honest lips; they value a man who speaks the truth. <DT>14 <DD>A king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will appease it. <DT>15 <DD>When a king's face brightens, it means life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring. <DT>16 <DD>How much better to get wisdom than gold, to choose understanding rather than silver! <DT>17 <DD>The highway of the upright avoids evil; he who guards his way guards his life. <DT>18 <DD>Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. <DT>19 <DD>Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud. <DT>20 <DD>Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD. <DT>21 <DD>The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant words promote instruction.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_130815975_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>22 <DD>Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it, but folly brings punishment to fools. <DT>23 <DD>A wise man's heart guides his mouth, and his lips promote instruction.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_130815975_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>24 <DD>Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones. <DT>25 <DD>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. <DT>26 <DD>The laborer's appetite works for him; his hunger drives him on. <DT>27 <DD>A scoundrel plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire. <DT>28 <DD>A perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends. <DT>29 <DD>A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good. <DT>30 <DD>He who winks with his eye is plotting perversity; he who purses his lips is bent on evil. <DT>31 <DD>Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life. <DT>32 <DD>Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city. <DT>33 <DD>The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_130815975_1">[21] Or <I>words make a man persuasive</I></A></LI>
