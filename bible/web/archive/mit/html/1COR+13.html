</DL><B>1 Corinthians 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>If I speak in the tongues <sup>[<a href="#footnote_132759376_1">1</a>]</sup>   of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.<DT>2 <DD>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.<DT>3 <DD>If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_132759376_2">2</a>]</sup>   but have not love, I gain nothing.<DT>4 <DD>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.<DT>5 <DD>It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.<DT>6 <DD>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.<DT>7 <DD>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.<DT>8 <DD>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.<DT>9 <DD>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,<DT>10 <DD>but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.<DT>11 <DD>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.<DT>12 <DD>Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.<DT>13 <DD>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_132759376_1">[1] Or <I>languages</I></A></LI>
