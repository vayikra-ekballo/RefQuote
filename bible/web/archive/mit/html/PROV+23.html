</DL><B>Proverbs 23</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what <sup>[<a href="#footnote_252648311_1">1</a>]</sup>   is before you,<DT>2 <DD>and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony.<DT>3 <DD>Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive. <DT>4 <DD>Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint.<DT>5 <DD>Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. <DT>6 <DD>Do not eat the food of a stingy man, do not crave his delicacies;<DT>7 <DD>for he is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_252648311_2">2</a>]</sup>   &quot;Eat and drink,&quot; he says to you, but his heart is not with you.<DT>8 <DD>You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments. <DT>9 <DD>Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words. <DT>10 <DD>Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,<DT>11 <DD>for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you. <DT>12 <DD>Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge. <DT>13 <DD>Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod, he will not die.<DT>14 <DD>Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_252648311_3">3</a>]</sup>   <DT>15 <DD>My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad;<DT>16 <DD>my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. <DT>17 <DD>Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD.<DT>18 <DD>There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. <DT>19 <DD>Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path.<DT>20 <DD>Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat,<DT>21 <DD>for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags. <DT>22 <DD>Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.<DT>23 <DD>Buy the truth and do not sell it; get wisdom, discipline and understanding.<DT>24 <DD>The father of a righteous man has great joy; he who has a wise son delights in him.<DT>25 <DD>May your father and mother be glad; may she who gave you birth rejoice! <DT>26 <DD>My son, give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways,<DT>27 <DD>for a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well.<DT>28 <DD>Like a bandit she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men. <DT>29 <DD>Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?<DT>30 <DD>Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.<DT>31 <DD>Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!<DT>32 <DD>In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.<DT>33 <DD>Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.<DT>34 <DD>You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.<DT>35 <DD>&quot;They hit me,&quot; you will say, &quot;but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_252648311_1">[1] Or <I>who</I></A></LI>
