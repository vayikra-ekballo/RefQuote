But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: &quot;We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you.&quot; So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.<DT>19 <DD>Some of the men of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul.
