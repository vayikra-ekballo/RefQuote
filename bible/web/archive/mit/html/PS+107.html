</DL><B>Psalm 107</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 107 <DT>1 <DD>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.<DT>2 <DD>Let the redeemed of the LORD say this-- those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,<DT>3 <DD>those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_480841182_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>4 <DD>Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.<DT>5 <DD>They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.<DT>6 <DD>Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.<DT>7 <DD>He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.<DT>8 <DD>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,<DT>9 <DD>for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. <DT>10 <DD>Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom, prisoners suffering in iron chains,<DT>11 <DD>for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.<DT>12 <DD>So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.<DT>13 <DD>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.<DT>14 <DD>He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains.<DT>15 <DD>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,<DT>16 <DD>for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron. <DT>17 <DD>Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.<DT>18 <DD>They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.<DT>19 <DD>Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.<DT>20 <DD>He sent forth his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.<DT>21 <DD>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.<DT>22 <DD>Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy. <DT>23 <DD>Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.<DT>24 <DD>They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep.<DT>25 <DD>For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.<DT>26 <DD>They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.<DT>27 <DD>They reeled and staggered like drunken men; they were at their wits' end.<DT>28 <DD>Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.<DT>29 <DD>He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.<DT>30 <DD>They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.<DT>31 <DD>Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men.<DT>32 <DD>Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. <DT>33 <DD>He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,<DT>34 <DD>and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.<DT>35 <DD>He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;<DT>36 <DD>there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.<DT>37 <DD>They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;<DT>38 <DD>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish. <DT>39 <DD>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;<DT>40 <DD>he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.<DT>41 <DD>But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks.<DT>42 <DD>The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths. <DT>43 <DD>Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_480841182_1">[3] Hebrew <I>north and the sea</I></A></LI>
