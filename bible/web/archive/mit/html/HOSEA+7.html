</DL><B>Hosea 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people, whenever I would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets;<DT>2 <DD>but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;They delight the king with their wickedness, the princes with their lies.<DT>4 <DD>They are all adulterers, burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises.<DT>5 <DD>On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers.<DT>6 <DD>Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.<DT>7 <DD>All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over.<DT>9 <DD>Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not notice.<DT>10 <DD>Israel's arrogance testifies against him, but despite all this he does not return to the LORD his God or search for him. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless-- now calling to Egypt, now turning to Assyria.<DT>12 <DD>When they go, I will throw my net over them; I will pull them down like birds of the air. When I hear them flocking together, I will catch them.<DT>13 <DD>Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak lies against me.<DT>14 <DD>They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail upon their beds. They gather together <sup>[<a href="#footnote_315146978_1">1</a>]</sup>   for grain and new wine but turn away from me.<DT>15 <DD>I trained them and strengthened them, but they plot evil against me.<DT>16 <DD>They do not turn to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_315146978_1">[14] Most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint <I>They slash themselves</I></A></LI>
