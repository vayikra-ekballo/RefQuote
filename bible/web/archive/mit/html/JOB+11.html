</DL><B>Job 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?<DT>3 <DD>Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?<DT>4 <DD>You say to God, `My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'<DT>5 <DD>Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you<DT>6 <DD>and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?<DT>8 <DD>They are higher than the heavens--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_1">1</a>]</sup>  --what can you know?<DT>9 <DD>Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?<DT>11 <DD>Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?<DT>12 <DD>But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_368351370_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>13 <DD>&quot;Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,<DT>14 <DD>if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,<DT>15 <DD>then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.<DT>16 <DD>You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.<DT>17 <DD>Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.<DT>18 <DD>You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.<DT>19 <DD>You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.<DT>20 <DD>But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_368351370_1">[8] Hebrew <I>than Sheol</I></A></LI>
