</DL><B>Psalm 17</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 17  A prayer of David.<DT>1 <DD>Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer-- it does not rise from deceitful lips.<DT>2 <DD>May my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right. <DT>3 <DD>Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, you will find nothing; I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.<DT>4 <DD>As for the deeds of men-- by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.<DT>5 <DD>My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not slipped. <DT>6 <DD>I call on you, O God, for you will answer me; give ear to me and hear my prayer.<DT>7 <DD>Show the wonder of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.<DT>8 <DD>Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings<DT>9 <DD>from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me. <DT>10 <DD>They close up their callous hearts, and their mouths speak with arrogance.<DT>11 <DD>They have tracked me down, they now surround me, with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground.<DT>12 <DD>They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a great lion crouching in cover. <DT>13 <DD>Rise up, O LORD, confront them, bring them down; rescue me from the wicked by your sword.<DT>14 <DD>O LORD, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life.  You still the hunger of those you cherish; their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.<DT>15 <DD>And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness. </DL><OL></OL>
