</DL><B>Job 41</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Can you pull in the leviathan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_1">1</a>]</sup>   with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?<DT>2 <DD>Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?<DT>3 <DD>Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?<DT>4 <DD>Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?<DT>5 <DD>Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?<DT>6 <DD>Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?<DT>7 <DD>Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?<DT>8 <DD>If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!<DT>9 <DD>Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.<DT>10 <DD>No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?<DT>11 <DD>Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.<DT>13 <DD>Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?<DT>14 <DD>Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?<DT>15 <DD>His back has <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_2">2</a>]</sup>   rows of shields tightly sealed together;<DT>16 <DD>each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.<DT>17 <DD>They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.<DT>18 <DD>His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.<DT>19 <DD>Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.<DT>20 <DD>Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.<DT>21 <DD>His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.<DT>22 <DD>Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.<DT>23 <DD>The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.<DT>24 <DD>His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.<DT>25 <DD>When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.<DT>26 <DD>The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.<DT>27 <DD>Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.<DT>28 <DD>Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.<DT>29 <DD>A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.<DT>30 <DD>His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.<DT>31 <DD>He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.<DT>32 <DD>Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.<DT>33 <DD>Nothing on earth is his equal-- a creature without fear.<DT>34 <DD>He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_910790070_1">[1] Possibly the crocodile</A></LI>
