</DL><B>Joel 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>`In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,<DT>2 <DD>I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_1">1</a>]</sup>   There I will enter into judgment against them concerning my inheritance, my people Israel, for they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.<DT>3 <DD>They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine that they might drink.<DT>4 <DD>`Now what have you against me, O Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done.<DT>5 <DD>For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.<DT>6 <DD>You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland.<DT>7 <DD>`See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done.<DT>8 <DD>I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.` The LORD has spoken.<DT>9 <DD>Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.<DT>10 <DD>Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, `I am strong!`<DT>11 <DD>Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there.  Bring down your warriors, O LORD! <DT>12 <DD>`Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side.<DT>13 <DD>Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow-- so great is their wickedness!` <DT>14 <DD>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.<DT>15 <DD>The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine.<DT>16 <DD>The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the sky will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.<DT>17 <DD>`Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her. <DT>18 <DD>`In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house and will water the valley of acacias. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_125000557_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>19 <DD>But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.<DT>20 <DD>Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.<DT>21 <DD>Their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned, I will pardon.`   The LORD dwells in Zion!  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_125000557_1"><I>2</I> <I>Jehoshaphat</I> means <I>the LORD judges</I>; also in verse 12.</A></LI>
