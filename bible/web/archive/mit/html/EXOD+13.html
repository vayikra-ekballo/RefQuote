</DL><B>Exodus 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or animal.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then Moses said to the people, &quot;Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.<DT>4 <DD>Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.<DT>5 <DD>When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites--the land he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey--you are to observe this ceremony in this month:<DT>6 <DD>For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.<DT>8 <DD>On that day tell your son, `I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'<DT>9 <DD>This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.<DT>10 <DD>You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers,<DT>12 <DD>you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.<DT>13 <DD>Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.<DT>14 <DD>&quot;In days to come, when your son asks you, `What does this mean?' say to him, `With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.<DT>15 <DD>When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'<DT>16 <DD>And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, &quot;If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_1">1</a>]</sup>   The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle.<DT>19 <DD>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He had said, &quot;God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>20 <DD>After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.<DT>21 <DD>By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.<DT>22 <DD>Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_169500052_1">[18] Hebrew <I>Yam Suph</I>; that is, Sea of Reeds</A></LI>
