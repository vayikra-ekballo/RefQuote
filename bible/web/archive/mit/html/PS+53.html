</DL><B>Psalm 53</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 53  For the director of music. According to mahalath. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_1">1</a>]</sup>   A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_187326134_2">2</a>]</sup>   of David.<DT>1 <DD>The fool says in his heart, &quot;There is no God.&quot; They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good. <DT>2 <DD>God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.<DT>3 <DD>Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. <DT>4 <DD>Will the evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?<DT>5 <DD>There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them. <DT>6 <DD>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_187326134_1">[Title: Probably a musical term</A></LI>
