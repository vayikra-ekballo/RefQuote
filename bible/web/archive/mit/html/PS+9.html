To [the tune of] &quot;The Death of the Son.&quot; A psalm of David.  <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>1 <DD>I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders.<DT>2 <DD>I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. <DT>3 <DD>My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.<DT>4 <DD>For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously.<DT>5 <DD>You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.<DT>6 <DD>Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished. <DT>7 <DD>The LORD reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.<DT>8 <DD>He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice.<DT>9 <DD>The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.<DT>10 <DD>Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you. <DT>11 <DD>Sing praises to the LORD, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.<DT>12 <DD>For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted. <DT>13 <DD>O LORD, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,<DT>14 <DD>that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.<DT>15 <DD>The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.<DT>16 <DD>The LORD is known by his justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.  Higgaion. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_2">2</a>]</sup>   Selah<DT>17 <DD>The wicked return to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_219452745_3">3</a>]</sup>   all the nations that forget God.<DT>18 <DD>But the needy will not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the afflicted ever perish. <DT>19 <DD>Arise, O LORD, let not man triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.<DT>20 <DD>Strike them with terror, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men.
