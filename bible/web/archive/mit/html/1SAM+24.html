</DL><B>1 Samuel 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, &quot;David is in the Desert of En Gedi.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.<DT>3 <DD>He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.<DT>4 <DD>The men said, &quot;This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102770326_1">1</a>]</sup>   to you, `I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'&quot; Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.<DT>5 <DD>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.<DT>6 <DD>He said to his men, &quot;The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.<DT>8 <DD>Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, &quot;My lord the king!&quot; When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.<DT>9 <DD>He said to Saul, &quot;Why do you listen when men say, `David is bent on harming you'?<DT>10 <DD>This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, `I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the LORD's anointed.'<DT>11 <DD>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.<DT>12 <DD>May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.<DT>13 <DD>As the old saying goes, `From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.<DT>14 <DD>&quot;Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?<DT>15 <DD>May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, &quot;Is that your voice, David my son?&quot; And he wept aloud.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;You are more righteous than I,&quot; he said. &quot;You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.<DT>18 <DD>You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.<DT>19 <DD>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today.<DT>20 <DD>I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.<DT>21 <DD>Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102770326_1">[4] Or <I>"Today the LORD is saying</I></A></LI>
