</DL><B>1 Corinthians 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife.<DT>2 <DD>And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?<DT>3 <DD>Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.<DT>4 <DD>When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,<DT>5 <DD>hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_1">1</a>]</sup>   may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.<DT>6 <DD>Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?<DT>7 <DD>Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.<DT>8 <DD>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.<DT>9 <DD>I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--<DT>10 <DD>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.<DT>11 <DD>But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.<DT>12 <DD>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?<DT>13 <DD>God will judge those outside. &quot;Expel the wicked man from among you.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_2">2</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_533091100_1">[5] Or <I>that his body</I>; or <I>that the flesh</I></A></LI>
