</DL><B>Habakkuk 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received. <DT>2 <DD>How long, O LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, &quot;Violence!&quot; but you do not save?<DT>3 <DD>Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds.<DT>4 <DD>Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Look at the nations and watch-- and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.<DT>6 <DD>I am raising up the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_1">1</a>]</sup>   that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.<DT>7 <DD>They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.<DT>8 <DD>Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour;<DT>9 <DD>they all come bent on violence. Their hordes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_2">2</a>]</sup>   advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.<DT>10 <DD>They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; they build earthen ramps and capture them.<DT>11 <DD>Then they sweep past like the wind and go on-- guilty men, whose own strength is their god.&quot; <DT>12 <DD>O LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.<DT>13 <DD>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?<DT>14 <DD>You have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.<DT>15 <DD>The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad.<DT>16 <DD>Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.<DT>17 <DD>Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy? </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_756827092_1">[6] Or <I>Chaldeans</I></A></LI>
