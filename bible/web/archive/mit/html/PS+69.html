</DL><B>Psalm 69</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 69  For the director of music. To [the tune of] &quot;Lilies.&quot; Of David.<DT>1 <DD>Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.<DT>2 <DD>I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.<DT>3 <DD>I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.<DT>4 <DD>Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal. <DT>5 <DD>You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you. <DT>6 <DD>May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.<DT>7 <DD>For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.<DT>8 <DD>I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;<DT>9 <DD>for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.<DT>10 <DD>When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;<DT>11 <DD>when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.<DT>12 <DD>Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards. <DT>13 <DD>But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.<DT>14 <DD>Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.<DT>15 <DD>Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.<DT>16 <DD>Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.<DT>17 <DD>Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.<DT>18 <DD>Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes. <DT>19 <DD>You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.<DT>20 <DD>Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.<DT>21 <DD>They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst. <DT>22 <DD>May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup>   a trap.<DT>23 <DD>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.<DT>24 <DD>Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.<DT>25 <DD>May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.<DT>26 <DD>For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.<DT>27 <DD>Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.<DT>28 <DD>May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous. <DT>29 <DD>I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me. <DT>30 <DD>I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.<DT>31 <DD>This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.<DT>32 <DD>The poor will see and be glad-- you who seek God, may your hearts live!<DT>33 <DD>The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people. <DT>34 <DD>Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,<DT>35 <DD>for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;<DT>36 <DD>the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_129182958_1">[22] Or <I>snare  and their fellowship become</I></A></LI>
