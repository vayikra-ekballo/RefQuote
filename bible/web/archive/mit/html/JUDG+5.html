</DL><B>Judges 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves-- praise the LORD! <DT>3 <DD>&quot;Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_1">1</a>]</sup>   the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_2">2</a>]</sup>   the LORD, the God of Israel. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.<DT>5 <DD>The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. <DT>6 <DD>&quot;In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.<DT>7 <DD>Village life <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_3">3</a>]</sup>   in Israel ceased, ceased until I, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_4">4</a>]</sup>   Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.<DT>8 <DD>When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.<DT>9 <DD>My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD! <DT>10 <DD>&quot;You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider<DT>11 <DD>the voice of the singers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_5">5</a>]</sup>   at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_6">6</a>]</sup>   in Israel.  &quot;Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates.<DT>12 <DD>`Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.' <DT>13 <DD>&quot;Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty.<DT>14 <DD>Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff.<DT>15 <DD>The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.<DT>16 <DD>Why did you stay among the campfires <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587968133_7">7</a>]</sup>   to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.<DT>17 <DD>Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.<DT>18 <DD>The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field. <DT>19 <DD>&quot;Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder.<DT>20 <DD>From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.<DT>21 <DD>The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!<DT>22 <DD>Then thundered the horses' hoofs-- galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.<DT>23 <DD>`Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. `Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.' <DT>24 <DD>&quot;Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.<DT>25 <DD>He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.<DT>26 <DD>Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.<DT>27 <DD>At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead. <DT>28 <DD>&quot;Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, `Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?'<DT>29 <DD>The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,<DT>30 <DD>`Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck-- all this as plunder?' <DT>31 <DD>&quot;So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength.&quot; Then the land had peace forty years. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_587968133_1">[3] Or <I>of</I></A></LI>
