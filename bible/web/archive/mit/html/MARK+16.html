</DL><B>Mark 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.<DT>2 <DD>Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb<DT>3 <DD>and they asked each other, &quot;Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?&quot;<DT>4 <DD>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.<DT>5 <DD>As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Don't be alarmed,&quot; he said. &quot;You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.<DT>7 <DD>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.<DT>9 <DD><sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_1">1</a>]</sup>   When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.<DT>10 <DD>She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.<DT>11 <DD>When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.<DT>12 <DD>Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.<DT>13 <DD>These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.<DT>14 <DD>Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.<DT>15 <DD>He said to them, &quot;Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.<DT>16 <DD>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.<DT>17 <DD>And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;<DT>18 <DD>they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.<DT>20 <DD>Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_124154384_1">The most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9-20.</A></LI>
