</DL><B>Proverbs 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. <DT>2 <DD>The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth of the fool gushes folly. <DT>3 <DD>The eyes of the LORD are everywhere, keeping watch on the wicked and the good. <DT>4 <DD>The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit. <DT>5 <DD>A fool spurns his father's discipline, but whoever heeds correction shows prudence. <DT>6 <DD>The house of the righteous contains great treasure, but the income of the wicked brings them trouble. <DT>7 <DD>The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so the hearts of fools. <DT>8 <DD>The LORD detests the sacrifice of the wicked, but the prayer of the upright pleases him. <DT>9 <DD>The LORD detests the way of the wicked but he loves those who pursue righteousness. <DT>10 <DD>Stern discipline awaits him who leaves the path; he who hates correction will die. <DT>11 <DD>Death and Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162205885_1">1</a>]</sup>   lie open before the LORD-- how much more the hearts of men! <DT>12 <DD>A mocker resents correction; he will not consult the wise. <DT>13 <DD>A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit. <DT>14 <DD>The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly. <DT>15 <DD>All the days of the oppressed are wretched, but the cheerful heart has a continual feast. <DT>16 <DD>Better a little with the fear of the LORD than great wealth with turmoil. <DT>17 <DD>Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred. <DT>18 <DD>A hot-tempered man stirs up dissension, but a patient man calms a quarrel. <DT>19 <DD>The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway. <DT>20 <DD>A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish man despises his mother. <DT>21 <DD>Folly delights a man who lacks judgment, but a man of understanding keeps a straight course. <DT>22 <DD>Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed. <DT>23 <DD>A man finds joy in giving an apt reply-- and how good is a timely word! <DT>24 <DD>The path of life leads upward for the wise to keep him from going down to the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162205885_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>25 <DD>The LORD tears down the proud man's house but he keeps the widow's boundaries intact. <DT>26 <DD>The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked, but those of the pure are pleasing to him. <DT>27 <DD>A greedy man brings trouble to his family, but he who hates bribes will live. <DT>28 <DD>The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil. <DT>29 <DD>The LORD is far from the wicked but he hears the prayer of the righteous. <DT>30 <DD>A cheerful look brings joy to the heart, and good news gives health to the bones. <DT>31 <DD>He who listens to a life-giving rebuke will be at home among the wise. <DT>32 <DD>He who ignores discipline despises himself, but whoever heeds correction gains understanding. <DT>33 <DD>The fear of the LORD teaches a man wisdom, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_162205885_3">3</a>]</sup>   and humility comes before honor. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_162205885_1">[11] Hebrew <I>Sheol and Abaddon</I></A></LI>
