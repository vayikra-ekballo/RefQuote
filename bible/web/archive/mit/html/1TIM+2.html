</DL><B>1 Timothy 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone--<DT>2 <DD>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.<DT>3 <DD>This is good, and pleases God our Savior,<DT>4 <DD>who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.<DT>5 <DD>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<DT>6 <DD>who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.<DT>7 <DD>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.<DT>8 <DD>I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.<DT>9 <DD>I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,<DT>10 <DD>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.<DT>11 <DD>A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.<DT>12 <DD>I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.<DT>13 <DD>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.<DT>14 <DD>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.<DT>15 <DD>But women <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176555845_1">1</a>]</sup>   will be saved <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176555845_2">2</a>]</sup>   through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_176555845_1">[15] Greek <I>she</I></A></LI>
