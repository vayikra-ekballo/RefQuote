</DL><B>Ephesians 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children<DT>2 <DD>and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.<DT>3 <DD>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.<DT>4 <DD>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.<DT>5 <DD>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>6 <DD>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.<DT>7 <DD>Therefore do not be partners with them.<DT>8 <DD>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light<DT>9 <DD>(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)<DT>10 <DD>and find out what pleases the Lord.<DT>11 <DD>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.<DT>12 <DD>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.<DT>13 <DD>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,<DT>14 <DD>for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: &quot;Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,<DT>16 <DD>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.<DT>17 <DD>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.<DT>18 <DD>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.<DT>19 <DD>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,<DT>20 <DD>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<DT>21 <DD>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<DT>22 <DD>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.<DT>23 <DD>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.<DT>24 <DD>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.<DT>25 <DD>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her<DT>26 <DD>to make her holy, cleansing <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_2">2</a>]</sup>   her by the washing with water through the word,<DT>27 <DD>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.<DT>28 <DD>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.<DT>29 <DD>After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--<DT>30 <DD>for we are members of his body.<DT>31 <DD>&quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>32 <DD>This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.<DT>33 <DD>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_158199311_1">[5] Or <I>kingdom of the Christ and God</I></A></LI>
