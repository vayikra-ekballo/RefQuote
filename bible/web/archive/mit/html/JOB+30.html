</DL><B>Job 30</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.<DT>2 <DD>Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?<DT>3 <DD>Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_1">1</a>]</sup>   the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.<DT>4 <DD>In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_2">2</a>]</sup>   was the root of the broom tree.<DT>5 <DD>They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.<DT>6 <DD>They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.<DT>7 <DD>They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.<DT>8 <DD>A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.<DT>10 <DD>They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.<DT>11 <DD>Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.<DT>12 <DD>On my right the tribe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_3">3</a>]</sup>   attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.<DT>13 <DD>They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me-- without anyone's helping them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.<DT>15 <DD>Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.<DT>17 <DD>Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.<DT>18 <DD>In his great power [God] becomes like clothing to me <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102876638_5">5</a>]</sup>  ; he binds me like the neck of my garment.<DT>19 <DD>He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.<DT>21 <DD>You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.<DT>22 <DD>You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.<DT>23 <DD>I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living. <DT>24 <DD>&quot;Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.<DT>25 <DD>Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?<DT>26 <DD>Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.<DT>27 <DD>The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.<DT>28 <DD>I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.<DT>29 <DD>I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.<DT>30 <DD>My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.<DT>31 <DD>My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102876638_1">[3] Or <I>gnawed</I></A></LI>
