</DL><B>Song of Solomon 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I am a rose <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_1">1</a>]</sup>   of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.<DT>2 <DD>Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens.<DT>3 <DD>Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.<DT>4 <DD>He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love.<DT>5 <DD>Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.<DT>6 <DD>His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.<DT>7 <DD>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires. <DT>8 <DD>Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.<DT>9 <DD>My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.<DT>10 <DD>My lover spoke and said to me, &quot;Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come with me.<DT>11 <DD>See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.<DT>12 <DD>Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.<DT>13 <DD>The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.<DT>15 <DD>Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.<DT>16 <DD>My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.<DT>17 <DD>Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_184292258_2">2</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_184292258_1">[1] Possibly a member of the crocus family</A></LI>
