</DL><B>2 Samuel 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,<DT>2 <DD>he said to Nathan the prophet, &quot;Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Nathan replied to the king, &quot;Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>That night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying: <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Go and tell my servant David, `This is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?<DT>6 <DD>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.<DT>7 <DD>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, &quot;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&quot;'<DT>8 <DD>&quot;Now then, tell my servant David, `This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.<DT>9 <DD>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men of the earth.<DT>10 <DD>And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning<DT>11 <DD>and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_1">1</a>]</sup>   over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. &quot;`The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you:<DT>12 <DD>When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.<DT>13 <DD>He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.<DT>14 <DD>I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.<DT>15 <DD>But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.<DT>16 <DD>Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; your throne will be established forever.'&quot; <DT>17 <DD>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. <DT>18 <DD>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said:  &quot;Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?<DT>19 <DD>And as if this were not enough in your sight, O Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant. Is this your usual way of dealing with man, O Sovereign LORD?<DT>20 <DD>&quot;What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign LORD.<DT>21 <DD>For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.<DT>22 <DD>&quot;How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.<DT>23 <DD>And who is like your people Israel--the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_533091100_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>24 <DD>You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,<DT>26 <DD>so that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, `The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.<DT>27 <DD>&quot;O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, `I will build a house for you.' So your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer.<DT>28 <DD>O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.<DT>29 <DD>Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_533091100_1">[11] Traditionally <I>judges</I></A></LI>
