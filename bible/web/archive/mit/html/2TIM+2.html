</DL><B>2 Timothy 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.<DT>2 <DD>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.<DT>3 <DD>Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.<DT>4 <DD>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.<DT>5 <DD>Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.<DT>6 <DD>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.<DT>7 <DD>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.<DT>8 <DD>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,<DT>9 <DD>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.<DT>10 <DD>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.<DT>11 <DD>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;<DT>12 <DD>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;<DT>13 <DD>if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.<DT>14 <DD>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.<DT>15 <DD>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.<DT>16 <DD>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.<DT>17 <DD>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,<DT>18 <DD>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.<DT>19 <DD>Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: &quot;The Lord knows those who are his,&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_146272288_1">1</a>]</sup>   and, &quot;Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.<DT>21 <DD>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.<DT>22 <DD>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<DT>23 <DD>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.<DT>24 <DD>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.<DT>25 <DD>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,<DT>26 <DD>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_146272288_1">[19] Num. 16:5 (see Septuagint)</A></LI>
