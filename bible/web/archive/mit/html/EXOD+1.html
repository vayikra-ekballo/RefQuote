</DL><B>Exodus 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:<DT>2 <DD>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;<DT>3 <DD>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;<DT>4 <DD>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.<DT>5 <DD>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_1">1</a>]</sup>   in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.<DT>6 <DD>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,<DT>7 <DD>but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.<DT>8 <DD>Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Look,&quot; he said to his people, &quot;the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.<DT>10 <DD>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.<DT>12 <DD>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites<DT>13 <DD>and worked them ruthlessly.<DT>14 <DD>They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.<DT>15 <DD>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,<DT>16 <DD>&quot;When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.<DT>18 <DD>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, &quot;Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?&quot;<DT>19 <DD>The midwives answered Pharaoh, &quot;Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.<DT>21 <DD>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.<DT>22 <DD>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: &quot;Every boy that is born <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_2">2</a>]</sup>   you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_213485129_1">[5] Masoretic Text (see also Gen. 46:27); Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint (see also Acts 7:14 and note at Gen. 46:27) <I>seventy-five</I></A></LI>
