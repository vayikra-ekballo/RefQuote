</DL><B>Job 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.<DT>2 <DD>He had seven sons and three daughters,<DT>3 <DD>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.<DT>4 <DD>His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.<DT>5 <DD>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, &quot;Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&quot; This was Job's regular custom.<DT>6 <DD>One day the angels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup>   came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup>   also came with them.<DT>7 <DD>The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Where have you come from?&quot; Satan answered the LORD, &quot;From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Then the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>&quot;Does Job fear God for nothing?&quot; Satan replied.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.<DT>11 <DD>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.&quot; Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.<DT>13 <DD>One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,<DT>14 <DD>a messenger came to Job and said, &quot;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,<DT>15 <DD>and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&quot;<DT>16 <DD>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, &quot;The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&quot;<DT>17 <DD>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, &quot;The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&quot;<DT>18 <DD>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, &quot;Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,<DT>19 <DD>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&quot;<DT>20 <DD>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship<DT>21 <DD>and said: &quot;Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_3">3</a>]</sup>   The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_126533812_1">[6] Hebrew <I>the sons of God</I></A></LI>
