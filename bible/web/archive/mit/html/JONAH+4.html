</DL><B>Jonah 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry.<DT>2 <DD>He prayed to the LORD, &quot;O LORD, is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity.<DT>3 <DD>Now, O LORD, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>But the LORD replied, &quot;Have you any right to be angry?&quot;<DT>5 <DD>Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.<DT>6 <DD>Then the LORD God provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the vine.<DT>7 <DD>But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the vine so that it withered.<DT>8 <DD>When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, &quot;It would be better for me to die than to live.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>But God said to Jonah, &quot;Do you have a right to be angry about the vine?&quot; &quot;I do,&quot; he said. &quot;I am angry enough to die.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>But the LORD said, &quot;You have been concerned about this vine, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.<DT>11 <DD>But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?&quot;  </DL><OL></OL>
