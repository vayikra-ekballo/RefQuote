</DL><B>Acts 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.<DT>2 <DD>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him<DT>3 <DD>and said, &quot;You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened:<DT>5 <DD>&quot;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.<DT>6 <DD>I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.<DT>7 <DD>Then I heard a voice telling me, `Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'<DT>8 <DD>&quot;I replied, `Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'<DT>9 <DD>&quot;The voice spoke from heaven a second time, `Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'<DT>10 <DD>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.<DT>12 <DD>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.<DT>13 <DD>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, `Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.<DT>14 <DD>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'<DT>15 <DD>&quot;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.<DT>16 <DD>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: `John baptized with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_1">1</a>]</sup>   water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'<DT>17 <DD>So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?&quot;<DT>18 <DD>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, &quot;So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.<DT>20 <DD>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.<DT>21 <DD>The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.<DT>22 <DD>News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.<DT>23 <DD>When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.<DT>24 <DD>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.<DT>25 <DD>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,<DT>26 <DD>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.<DT>27 <DD>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.<DT>28 <DD>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)<DT>29 <DD>The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.<DT>30 <DD>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_167332253_1">[16] Or <I>in</I></A></LI>
