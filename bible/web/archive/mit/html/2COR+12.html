</DL><B>2 Corinthians 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.<DT>2 <DD>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God knows.<DT>3 <DD>And I know that this man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows--<DT>4 <DD>was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.<DT>5 <DD>I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.<DT>6 <DD>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.<DT>7 <DD>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.<DT>8 <DD>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.<DT>9 <DD>But he said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.<DT>10 <DD>That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<DT>11 <DD>I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the &quot;super-apostles,&quot; even though I am nothing.<DT>12 <DD>The things that mark an apostle--signs, wonders and miracles--were done among you with great perseverance.<DT>13 <DD>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!<DT>14 <DD>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.<DT>15 <DD>So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?<DT>16 <DD>Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!<DT>17 <DD>Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you?<DT>18 <DD>I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course?<DT>19 <DD>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.<DT>20 <DD>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.<DT>21 <DD>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.</DL><OL></OL>
