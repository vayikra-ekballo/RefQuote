</DL><B>Psalm 105</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 105 <DT>1 <DD>Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.<DT>2 <DD>Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.<DT>3 <DD>Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.<DT>4 <DD>Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always. <DT>5 <DD>Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,<DT>6 <DD>O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.<DT>7 <DD>He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. <DT>8 <DD>He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,<DT>9 <DD>the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.<DT>10 <DD>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:<DT>11 <DD>&quot;To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.&quot; <DT>12 <DD>When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,<DT>13 <DD>they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.<DT>14 <DD>He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:<DT>15 <DD>&quot;Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.&quot; <DT>16 <DD>He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;<DT>17 <DD>and he sent a man before them-- Joseph, sold as a slave.<DT>18 <DD>They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,<DT>19 <DD>till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.<DT>20 <DD>The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.<DT>21 <DD>He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,<DT>22 <DD>to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom. <DT>23 <DD>Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.<DT>24 <DD>The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,<DT>25 <DD>whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.<DT>26 <DD>He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<DT>27 <DD>They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.<DT>28 <DD>He sent darkness and made the land dark-- for had they not rebelled against his words?<DT>29 <DD>He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.<DT>30 <DD>Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.<DT>31 <DD>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.<DT>32 <DD>He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;<DT>33 <DD>he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.<DT>34 <DD>He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;<DT>35 <DD>they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.<DT>36 <DD>Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood. <DT>37 <DD>He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.<DT>38 <DD>Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.<DT>39 <DD>He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.<DT>40 <DD>They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.<DT>41 <DD>He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert. <DT>42 <DD>For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.<DT>43 <DD>He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;<DT>44 <DD>he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for--<DT>45 <DD>that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws.
