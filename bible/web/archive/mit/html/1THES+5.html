</DL><B>1 Thessalonians 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,<DT>2 <DD>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.<DT>3 <DD>While people are saying, &quot;Peace and safety,&quot; destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.<DT>4 <DD>But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.<DT>5 <DD>You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.<DT>6 <DD>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.<DT>7 <DD>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.<DT>8 <DD>But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.<DT>9 <DD>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.<DT>10 <DD>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.<DT>11 <DD>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.<DT>12 <DD>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.<DT>13 <DD>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.<DT>14 <DD>And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.<DT>15 <DD>Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.<DT>16 <DD>Be joyful always;<DT>17 <DD>pray continually;<DT>18 <DD>give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.<DT>19 <DD>Do not put out the Spirit's fire;<DT>20 <DD>do not treat prophecies with contempt.<DT>21 <DD>Test everything. Hold on to the good.<DT>22 <DD>Avoid every kind of evil.<DT>23 <DD>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<DT>24 <DD>The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it. <DT>25 <DD>Brothers, pray for us.<DT>26 <DD>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.<DT>27 <DD>I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.<DT>28 <DD>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </DL><OL></OL>
