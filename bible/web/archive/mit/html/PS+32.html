</DL><B>Psalm 32</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 32  Of David. A maskil. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_742419354_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>1 <DD>Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.<DT>2 <DD>Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit. <DT>3 <DD>When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.<DT>4 <DD>For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.  Selah<DT>5 <DD>Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, &quot;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD&quot;-- and you forgave the guilt of my sin.  Selah <DT>6 <DD>Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.<DT>7 <DD>You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah <DT>8 <DD>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.<DT>9 <DD>Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.<DT>10 <DD>Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him. <DT>11 <DD>Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_742419354_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
