</DL><B>Titus 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.<DT>2 <DD>Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.<DT>3 <DD>Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.<DT>4 <DD>Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,<DT>5 <DD>to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.<DT>6 <DD>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.<DT>7 <DD>In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness<DT>8 <DD>and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.<DT>9 <DD>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,<DT>10 <DD>and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.<DT>11 <DD>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.<DT>12 <DD>It teaches us to say &quot;No&quot; to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,<DT>13 <DD>while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,<DT>14 <DD>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.<DT>15 <DD>These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</DL><OL></OL>
