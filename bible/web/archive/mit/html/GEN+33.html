</DL><B>Genesis 33</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.<DT>2 <DD>He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.<DT>3 <DD>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.<DT>4 <DD>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.<DT>5 <DD>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. &quot;Who are these with you?&quot; he asked. Jacob answered, &quot;They are the children God has graciously given your servant.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.<DT>7 <DD>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.<DT>8 <DD>Esau asked, &quot;What do you mean by all these droves I met?&quot; &quot;To find favor in your eyes, my lord,&quot; he said.<DT>9 <DD>But Esau said, &quot;I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>&quot;No, please!&quot; said Jacob. &quot;If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.<DT>11 <DD>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.&quot; And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.<DT>12 <DD>Then Esau said, &quot;Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>But Jacob said to him, &quot;My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.<DT>14 <DD>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Esau said, &quot;Then let me leave some of my men with you.&quot; &quot;But why do that?&quot; Jacob asked. &quot;Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.<DT>17 <DD>Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_2">2</a>]</sup>   he arrived safely at the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_3">3</a>]</sup>   city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.<DT>19 <DD>For a hundred pieces of silver, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_4">4</a>]</sup>   he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.<DT>20 <DD>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_420022404_5">5</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_420022404_1">[17] <I>Succoth</I> means <I>shelters.</I></A></LI>
