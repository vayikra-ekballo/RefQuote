</DL><B>Psalm 81</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 81  For the director of music. According to gittith. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_874045182_1">1</a>]</sup>   Of Asaph.<DT>1 <DD>Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob!<DT>2 <DD>Begin the music, strike the tambourine, play the melodious harp and lyre. <DT>3 <DD>Sound the ram's horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our Feast;<DT>4 <DD>this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<DT>5 <DD>He established it as a statute for Joseph when he went out against Egypt, where we heard a language we did not understand. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_874045182_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>6 <DD>He says, &quot;I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.<DT>7 <DD>In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Hear, O my people, and I will warn you-- if you would but listen to me, O Israel!<DT>9 <DD>You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not bow down to an alien god.<DT>10 <DD>I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.<DT>12 <DD>So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;If my people would but listen to me, if Israel would follow my ways,<DT>14 <DD>how quickly would I subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!<DT>15 <DD>Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.<DT>16 <DD>But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_874045182_1">[Title: Probably a musical term</A></LI>
