</DL><B>Hebrews 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.<DT>2 <DD>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.<DT>3 <DD>Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.<DT>4 <DD>For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.<DT>5 <DD>Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.<DT>6 <DD>But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.<DT>7 <DD>So, as the Holy Spirit says: &quot;Today, if you hear his voice,<DT>8 <DD>do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,<DT>9 <DD>where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.<DT>10 <DD>That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, `Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'<DT>11 <DD>So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>12 <DD>See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.<DT>13 <DD>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.<DT>14 <DD>We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.<DT>15 <DD>As has just been said: &quot;Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?<DT>17 <DD>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?<DT>18 <DD>And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_3">3</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>19 <DD>So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_107536116_1">[11] Psalm 95:7-11</A></LI>
