</DL><B>Isaiah 35</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,<DT>2 <DD>it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God. <DT>3 <DD>Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way;<DT>4 <DD>say to those with fearful hearts, &quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.&quot; <DT>5 <DD>Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.<DT>6 <DD>Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.<DT>7 <DD>The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow. <DT>8 <DD>And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_212887290_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there,<DT>10 <DD>and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_212887290_1">[8] Or <I> the simple will not stray from it</I></A></LI>
