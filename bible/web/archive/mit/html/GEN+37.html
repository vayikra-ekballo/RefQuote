</DL><B>Genesis 37</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. <DT>2 <DD>This is the account of Jacob.  Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.<DT>3 <DD>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   robe for him.<DT>4 <DD>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.<DT>5 <DD>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.<DT>6 <DD>He said to them, &quot;Listen to this dream I had:<DT>7 <DD>We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>His brothers said to him, &quot;Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?&quot; And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.<DT>9 <DD>Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. &quot;Listen,&quot; he said, &quot;I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, &quot;What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?&quot;<DT>11 <DD>His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.<DT>12 <DD>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,<DT>13 <DD>and Israel said to Joseph, &quot;As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; he replied.<DT>14 <DD>So he said to him, &quot;Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.&quot; Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,<DT>15 <DD>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, &quot;What are you looking for?&quot;<DT>16 <DD>He replied, &quot;I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?&quot;<DT>17 <DD>&quot;They have moved on from here,&quot; the man answered. &quot;I heard them say, `Let's go to Dothan.'&quot; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.<DT>18 <DD>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Here comes that dreamer!&quot; they said to each other.<DT>20 <DD>&quot;Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. &quot;Let's not take his life,&quot; he said.<DT>22 <DD>&quot;Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him.&quot; Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.<DT>23 <DD>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing--<DT>24 <DD>and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.<DT>25 <DD>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.<DT>26 <DD>Judah said to his brothers, &quot;What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?<DT>27 <DD>Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.&quot; His brothers agreed.<DT>28 <DD>So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup>   of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.<DT>29 <DD>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.<DT>30 <DD>He went back to his brothers and said, &quot;The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?&quot;<DT>31 <DD>Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.<DT>32 <DD>They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, &quot;We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>He recognized it and said, &quot;It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.&quot;<DT>34 <DD>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.<DT>35 <DD>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;in mourning will I go down to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_3">3</a>]</sup>   to my son.&quot; So his father wept for him.<DT>36 <DD>Meanwhile, the Midianites <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_4">4</a>]</sup>   sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[3] The meaning of the Hebrew for <I>richly ornamented</I> is uncertain; also in verses 23 and 32.</A></LI>
