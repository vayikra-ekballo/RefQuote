</DL><B>Lamentations 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD> <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_1">1</a>]</sup>    How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street. <DT>2 <DD>How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter's hands! <DT>3 <DD>Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert. <DT>4 <DD>Because of thirst the infant's tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them. <DT>5 <DD>Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps. <DT>6 <DD>The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her. <DT>7 <DD>Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_172736232_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>8 <DD>But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick. <DT>9 <DD>Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field. <DT>10 <DD>With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food when my people were destroyed. <DT>11 <DD>The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations. <DT>12 <DD>The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the world's people, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem. <DT>13 <DD>But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous. <DT>14 <DD>Now they grope through the streets like men who are blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;Go away! You are unclean!&quot; men cry to them. &quot;Away! Away! Don't touch us!&quot; When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say, &quot;They can stay here no longer.&quot; <DT>16 <DD>The LORD himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor. <DT>17 <DD>Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us. <DT>18 <DD>Men stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come. <DT>19 <DD>Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert. <DT>20 <DD>The LORD's anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations. <DT>21 <DD>Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked. <DT>22 <DD>O Daughter of Zion, your punishment will end; he will not prolong your exile. But, O Daughter of Edom, he will punish your sin and expose your wickedness. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_172736232_1">[This chapter is an acrostic poem, the verses of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</A></LI>
