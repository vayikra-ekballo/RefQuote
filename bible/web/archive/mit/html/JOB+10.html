</DL><B>Job 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.<DT>2 <DD>I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.<DT>3 <DD>Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?<DT>4 <DD>Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?<DT>5 <DD>Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,<DT>6 <DD>that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin--<DT>7 <DD>though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand? <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?<DT>9 <DD>Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?<DT>10 <DD>Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,<DT>11 <DD>clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?<DT>12 <DD>You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind:<DT>14 <DD>If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.<DT>15 <DD>If I am guilty--woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup>   my affliction.<DT>16 <DD>If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.<DT>17 <DD>You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.<DT>19 <DD>If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!<DT>20 <DD>Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy<DT>21 <DD>before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>22 <DD>to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_174971231_1">[15] Or <I>and aware of</I></A></LI>
