</DL><B>Deuteronomy 18</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The priests, who are Levites--indeed the whole tribe of Levi--are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the offerings made to the LORD by fire, for that is their inheritance.<DT>2 <DD>They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.<DT>3 <DD>This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the jowls and the inner parts.<DT>4 <DD>You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep,<DT>5 <DD>for the LORD your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD's name always.<DT>6 <DD>If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose,<DT>7 <DD>he may minister in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the LORD.<DT>8 <DD>He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.<DT>9 <DD>When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.<DT>10 <DD>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_1">1</a>]</sup>   the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,<DT>11 <DD>or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.<DT>12 <DD>Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you.<DT>13 <DD>You must be blameless before the LORD your God.<DT>14 <DD>The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so.<DT>15 <DD>The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.<DT>16 <DD>For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, &quot;Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>The LORD said to me: &quot;What they say is good.<DT>18 <DD>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.<DT>19 <DD>If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.<DT>20 <DD>But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>You may say to yourselves, &quot;How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?&quot;<DT>22 <DD>If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_171921359_1">[10] Or <I>who makes his son or daughter pass through</I></A></LI>
