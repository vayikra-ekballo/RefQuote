</DL><B>Ephesians 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--<DT>2 <DD>Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,<DT>3 <DD>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.<DT>4 <DD>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,<DT>5 <DD>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.<DT>6 <DD>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.<DT>7 <DD>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.<DT>8 <DD>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,<DT>9 <DD>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.<DT>10 <DD>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,<DT>11 <DD>according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.<DT>12 <DD>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.<DT>13 <DD>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.<DT>14 <DD>For this reason I kneel before the Father,<DT>15 <DD>from whom his whole family <sup>[<a href="#footnote_111776534_1">1</a>]</sup>   in heaven and on earth derives its name.<DT>16 <DD>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,<DT>17 <DD>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,<DT>18 <DD>may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,<DT>19 <DD>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.<DT>20 <DD>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,<DT>21 <DD>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_111776534_1">[15] Or <I>whom all fatherhood</I></A></LI>
