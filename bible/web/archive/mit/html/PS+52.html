</DL><B>Psalm 52</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 52  For the director of music. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_24408923_1">1</a>]</sup>   of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him: &quot;David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.&quot;<DT>1 <DD>Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?<DT>2 <DD>Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.<DT>3 <DD>You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah<DT>4 <DD>You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue! <DT>5 <DD>Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.  Selah<DT>6 <DD>The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at him, saying,<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!&quot; <DT>8 <DD>But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever.<DT>9 <DD>I will praise you forever for what you have done; in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_24408923_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
