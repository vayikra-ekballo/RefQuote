</DL><B>Jonah 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God.<DT>2 <DD>He said: &quot;In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From the depths of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_1">1</a>]</sup>   I called for help, and you listened to my cry.<DT>3 <DD>You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.<DT>4 <DD>I said, `I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'<DT>5 <DD>The engulfing waters threatened me, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_182944417_2">2</a>]</sup>   the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.<DT>6 <DD>To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit, O LORD my God. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.<DT>9 <DD>But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the LORD.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_182944417_1">[2] Hebrew <I>Sheol</I></A></LI>
