</DL><B>Job 34</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Elihu said:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.<DT>3 <DD>For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.<DT>4 <DD>Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Job says, `I am innocent, but God denies me justice.<DT>6 <DD>Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'<DT>7 <DD>What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?<DT>8 <DD>He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.<DT>9 <DD>For he says, `It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.' <DT>10 <DD>&quot;So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.<DT>11 <DD>He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.<DT>12 <DD>It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.<DT>13 <DD>Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?<DT>14 <DD>If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_1">1</a>]</sup>   and breath,<DT>15 <DD>all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.<DT>17 <DD>Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?<DT>18 <DD>Is he not the One who says to kings, `You are worthless,' and to nobles, `You are wicked,'<DT>19 <DD>who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?<DT>20 <DD>They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand. <DT>21 <DD>&quot;His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.<DT>22 <DD>There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.<DT>23 <DD>God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.<DT>24 <DD>Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.<DT>25 <DD>Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.<DT>26 <DD>He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,<DT>27 <DD>because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.<DT>28 <DD>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.<DT>29 <DD>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,<DT>30 <DD>to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people. <DT>31 <DD>&quot;Suppose a man says to God, `I am guilty but will offend no more.<DT>32 <DD>Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'<DT>33 <DD>Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know. <DT>34 <DD>&quot;Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,<DT>35 <DD>`Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'<DT>36 <DD>Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!<DT>37 <DD>To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_882130860_1">[14] Or <I>Spirit</I></A></LI>
