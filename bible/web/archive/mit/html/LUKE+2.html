</DL><B>Luke 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.<DT>2 <DD>(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)<DT>3 <DD>And everyone went to his own town to register.<DT>4 <DD>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.<DT>5 <DD>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.<DT>6 <DD>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,<DT>7 <DD>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.<DT>8 <DD>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.<DT>9 <DD>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.<DT>10 <DD>But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.<DT>11 <DD>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup>   the Lord.<DT>12 <DD>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,<DT>14 <DD>&quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &quot;Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.<DT>17 <DD>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,<DT>18 <DD>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.<DT>19 <DD>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.<DT>20 <DD>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.<DT>21 <DD>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.<DT>22 <DD>When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord<DT>23 <DD>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &quot;Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_2">2</a>]</sup>  ),<DT>24 <DD>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: &quot;a pair of doves or two young pigeons.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>25 <DD>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.<DT>26 <DD>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.<DT>27 <DD>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,<DT>28 <DD>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:<DT>29 <DD>&quot;Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_4">4</a>]</sup>   your servant in peace.<DT>30 <DD>For my eyes have seen your salvation,<DT>31 <DD>which you have prepared in the sight of all people,<DT>32 <DD>a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.<DT>34 <DD>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: &quot;This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,<DT>35 <DD>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.&quot;<DT>36 <DD>There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,<DT>37 <DD>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_5">5</a>]</sup>   She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.<DT>38 <DD>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.<DT>39 <DD>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.<DT>40 <DD>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.<DT>41 <DD>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.<DT>42 <DD>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.<DT>43 <DD>After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.<DT>44 <DD>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.<DT>45 <DD>When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.<DT>46 <DD>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.<DT>47 <DD>Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.<DT>48 <DD>When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, &quot;Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.&quot;<DT>49 <DD>&quot;Why were you searching for me?&quot; he asked. &quot;Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?&quot;<DT>50 <DD>But they did not understand what he was saying to them.<DT>51 <DD>Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.<DT>52 <DD>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_152113421_1">[11] Or <I>Messiah.</I> "The Christ" (Greek) and "the Messiah" (Hebrew) both mean "the Anointed One"; also in verse 26.</A></LI>
