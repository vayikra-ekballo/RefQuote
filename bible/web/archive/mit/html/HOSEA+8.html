</DL><B>Hosea 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the LORD because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.<DT>2 <DD>Israel cries out to me, `O our God, we acknowledge you!'<DT>3 <DD>But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.<DT>4 <DD>They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction.<DT>5 <DD>Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity?<DT>6 <DD>They are from Israel! This calf--a craftsman has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up.<DT>8 <DD>Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like a worthless thing.<DT>9 <DD>For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.<DT>10 <DD>Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning.<DT>12 <DD>I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something alien.<DT>13 <DD>They offer sacrifices given to me and they eat the meat, but the LORD is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.<DT>14 <DD>Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire upon their cities that will consume their fortresses.&quot; </DL><OL></OL>
