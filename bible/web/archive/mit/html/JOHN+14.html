</DL><B>John 14</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; trust also in me.<DT>2 <DD>In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.<DT>3 <DD>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.<DT>4 <DD>You know the way to the place where I am going.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>Thomas said to him, &quot;Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<DT>7 <DD>If you really knew me, you would know <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_2">2</a>]</sup>   my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Philip said, &quot;Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Jesus answered: &quot;Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father'?<DT>10 <DD>Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.<DT>11 <DD>Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.<DT>12 <DD>I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.<DT>13 <DD>And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.<DT>14 <DD>You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command.<DT>16 <DD>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever--<DT>17 <DD>the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_3">3</a>]</sup>   in you.<DT>18 <DD>I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.<DT>19 <DD>Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.<DT>20 <DD>On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<DT>21 <DD>Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, &quot;But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.<DT>24 <DD>He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;All this I have spoken while still with you.<DT>26 <DD>But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.<DT>27 <DD>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.<DT>28 <DD>&quot;You heard me say, `I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.<DT>29 <DD>I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.<DT>30 <DD>I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me,<DT>31 <DD>but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. &quot;Come now; let us leave.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_169500052_1">[1] Or <I>You trust in God</I></A></LI>
