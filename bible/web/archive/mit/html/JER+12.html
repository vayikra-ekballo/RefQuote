</DL><B>Jeremiah 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>You are always righteous, O LORD, when I bring a case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?<DT>2 <DD>You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts.<DT>3 <DD>Yet you know me, O LORD; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter!<DT>4 <DD>How long will the land lie parched <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_1">1</a>]</sup>   and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, &quot;He will not see what happens to us.&quot; <DT>5 <DD>&quot;If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_2">2</a>]</sup>   how will you manage in the thickets by <sup>[<a href="#footnote_377480891_3">3</a>]</sup>   the Jordan?<DT>6 <DD>Your brothers, your own family-- even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies.<DT>8 <DD>My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me; therefore I hate her.<DT>9 <DD>Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack? Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.<DT>10 <DD>Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.<DT>11 <DD>It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares.<DT>12 <DD>Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe.<DT>13 <DD>They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. So bear the shame of your harvest because of the LORD's fierce anger.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.<DT>15 <DD>But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to his own inheritance and his own country.<DT>16 <DD>And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, `As surely as the LORD lives'--even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal--then they will be established among my people.<DT>17 <DD>But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,&quot; declares the LORD.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_377480891_1">[4] Or <I>land mourn</I></A></LI>
