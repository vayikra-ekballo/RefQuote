</DL><B>Psalm 30</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 30  A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_135084674_1">1</a>]</sup>   Of David.<DT>1 <DD>I will exalt you, O LORD, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.<DT>2 <DD>O LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me.<DT>3 <DD>O LORD, you brought me up from the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_135084674_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; you spared me from going down into the pit. <DT>4 <DD>Sing to the LORD, you saints of his; praise his holy name.<DT>5 <DD>For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. <DT>6 <DD>When I felt secure, I said, &quot;I will never be shaken.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>O LORD, when you favored me, you made my mountain <sup>[<a href="#footnote_135084674_3">3</a>]</sup>   stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed. <DT>8 <DD>To you, O LORD, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:<DT>9 <DD>&quot;What gain is there in my destruction, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_135084674_4">4</a>]</sup>   in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?<DT>10 <DD>Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me; O LORD, be my help.&quot; <DT>11 <DD>You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,<DT>12 <DD>that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_135084674_1">[Title: Or <I>palace</I></A></LI>
