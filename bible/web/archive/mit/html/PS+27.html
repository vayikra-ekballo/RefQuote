The LORD is the stronghold of my life-- of whom shall I be afraid?<DT>2 <DD>When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_113339984_1">1</a>]</sup>   when my enemies and my foes attack me, they will stumble and fall.<DT>3 <DD>Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then will I be confident. <DT>4 <DD>One thing I ask of the LORD, this is what I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his temple.<DT>5 <DD>For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.<DT>6 <DD>Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD. <DT>7 <DD>Hear my voice when I call, O LORD; be merciful to me and answer me.<DT>8 <DD>My heart says of you, &quot;Seek his <sup>[<a href="#footnote_113339984_2">2</a>]</sup>   face!&quot; Your face, LORD, I will seek.<DT>9 <DD>Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, O God my Savior.<DT>10 <DD>Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.<DT>11 <DD>Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.<DT>12 <DD>Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. <DT>13 <DD>I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.<DT>14 <DD>Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_113339984_1">[2] Or <I>to slander me</I></A></LI>
