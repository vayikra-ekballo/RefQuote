</DL><B>Nahum 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. <DT>2 <DD>The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.<DT>3 <DD>The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.<DT>4 <DD>He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.<DT>5 <DD>The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it.<DT>6 <DD>Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him. <DT>7 <DD>The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,<DT>8 <DD>but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of [Nineveh]; he will pursue his foes into darkness. <DT>9 <DD>Whatever they plot against the LORD he <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_1">1</a>]</sup>   will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.<DT>10 <DD>They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>11 <DD>From you, [O Nineveh,] has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and counsels wickedness.<DT>12 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, [O Judah,] I will afflict you no more.<DT>13 <DD>Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away.&quot; <DT>14 <DD>The LORD has given a command concerning you, [Nineveh]: &quot;You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile.&quot; <DT>15 <DD>Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_154358411_1">[9] Or <I>What do you foes plot against the LORD?  He</I></A></LI>
