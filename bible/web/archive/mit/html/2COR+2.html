</DL><B>2 Corinthians 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.<DT>2 <DD>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?<DT>3 <DD>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.<DT>4 <DD>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.<DT>5 <DD>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.<DT>6 <DD>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.<DT>7 <DD>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.<DT>8 <DD>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.<DT>9 <DD>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.<DT>10 <DD>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,<DT>11 <DD>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.<DT>12 <DD>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,<DT>13 <DD>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.<DT>14 <DD>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.<DT>15 <DD>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.<DT>16 <DD>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?<DT>17 <DD>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.</DL><OL></OL>
