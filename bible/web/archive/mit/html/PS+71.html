</DL><B>Psalm 71</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 71 <DT>1 <DD>In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.<DT>2 <DD>Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me.<DT>3 <DD>Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.<DT>4 <DD>Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men. <DT>5 <DD>For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth.<DT>6 <DD>From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you.<DT>7 <DD>I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.<DT>8 <DD>My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long. <DT>9 <DD>Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.<DT>10 <DD>For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.<DT>11 <DD>They say, &quot;God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Be not far from me, O God; come quickly, O my God, to help me.<DT>13 <DD>May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace. <DT>14 <DD>But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.<DT>15 <DD>My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure.<DT>16 <DD>I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD; I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.<DT>17 <DD>Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.<DT>18 <DD>Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come. <DT>19 <DD>Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you?<DT>20 <DD>Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.<DT>21 <DD>You will increase my honor and comfort me once again. <DT>22 <DD>I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.<DT>23 <DD>My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you-- I, whom you have redeemed.<DT>24 <DD>My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion. </DL><OL></OL>
