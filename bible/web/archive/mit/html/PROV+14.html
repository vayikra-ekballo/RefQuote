</DL><B>Proverbs 14</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down. <DT>2 <DD>He whose walk is upright fears the LORD, but he whose ways are devious despises him. <DT>3 <DD>A fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them. <DT>4 <DD>Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the strength of an ox comes an abundant harvest. <DT>5 <DD>A truthful witness does not deceive, but a false witness pours out lies. <DT>6 <DD>The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning. <DT>7 <DD>Stay away from a foolish man, for you will not find knowledge on his lips. <DT>8 <DD>The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways, but the folly of fools is deception. <DT>9 <DD>Fools mock at making amends for sin, but goodwill is found among the upright. <DT>10 <DD>Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joy. <DT>11 <DD>The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish. <DT>12 <DD>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. <DT>13 <DD>Even in laughter the heart may ache, and joy may end in grief. <DT>14 <DD>The faithless will be fully repaid for their ways, and the good man rewarded for his. <DT>15 <DD>A simple man believes anything, but a prudent man gives thought to his steps. <DT>16 <DD>A wise man fears the LORD and shuns evil, but a fool is hotheaded and reckless. <DT>17 <DD>A quick-tempered man does foolish things, and a crafty man is hated. <DT>18 <DD>The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <DT>19 <DD>Evil men will bow down in the presence of the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. <DT>20 <DD>The poor are shunned even by their neighbors, but the rich have many friends. <DT>21 <DD>He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who is kind to the needy. <DT>22 <DD>Do not those who plot evil go astray? But those who plan what is good find <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_1">1</a>]</sup>   love and faithfulness. <DT>23 <DD>All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty. <DT>24 <DD>The wealth of the wise is their crown, but the folly of fools yields folly. <DT>25 <DD>A truthful witness saves lives, but a false witness is deceitful. <DT>26 <DD>He who fears the LORD has a secure fortress, and for his children it will be a refuge. <DT>27 <DD>The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death. <DT>28 <DD>A large population is a king's glory, but without subjects a prince is ruined. <DT>29 <DD>A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly. <DT>30 <DD>A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones. <DT>31 <DD>He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God. <DT>32 <DD>When calamity comes, the wicked are brought down, but even in death the righteous have a refuge. <DT>33 <DD>Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning and even among fools she lets herself be known. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_842751361_2">2</a>]</sup>   <DT>34 <DD>Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people. <DT>35 <DD>A king delights in a wise servant, but a shameful servant incurs his wrath. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_842751361_1">[22] Or <I>show</I></A></LI>
