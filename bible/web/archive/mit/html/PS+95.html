Today, if you hear his voice,<DT>8 <DD>do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_1">1</a>]</sup>   as you did that day at Massah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_910790070_2">2</a>]</sup>   in the desert,<DT>9 <DD>where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did.<DT>10 <DD>For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, &quot;They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>So I declared on oath in my anger, &quot;They shall never enter my rest.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_910790070_1">[8] <I>Meribah</I> means <I>quarreling.</I></A></LI>
