</DL><B>Job 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.<DT>2 <DD>What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.<DT>3 <DD>But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.<DT>4 <DD>You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!<DT>5 <DD>If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.<DT>6 <DD>Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.<DT>7 <DD>Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?<DT>8 <DD>Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?<DT>9 <DD>Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?<DT>10 <DD>He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.<DT>11 <DD>Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?<DT>12 <DD>Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.<DT>14 <DD>Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?<DT>15 <DD>Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely <sup>[<a href="#footnote_829516147_1">1</a>]</sup>   defend my ways to his face.<DT>16 <DD>Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!<DT>17 <DD>Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say.<DT>18 <DD>Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.<DT>19 <DD>Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you:<DT>21 <DD>Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.<DT>22 <DD>Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.<DT>23 <DD>How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.<DT>24 <DD>Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?<DT>25 <DD>Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?<DT>26 <DD>For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.<DT>27 <DD>You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet. <DT>28 <DD>&quot;So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_829516147_1">[15] Or <I>He will surely slay me; I have no hope -- / yet I will</I></A></LI>
