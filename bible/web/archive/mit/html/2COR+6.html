</DL><B>2 Corinthians 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.<DT>2 <DD>For he says, &quot;In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_1">1</a>]</sup>   I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.<DT>3 <DD>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.<DT>4 <DD>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;<DT>5 <DD>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;<DT>6 <DD>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;<DT>7 <DD>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;<DT>8 <DD>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;<DT>9 <DD>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;<DT>10 <DD>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.<DT>11 <DD>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.<DT>12 <DD>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.<DT>13 <DD>As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also.<DT>14 <DD>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?<DT>15 <DD>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_2">2</a>]</sup>  ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?<DT>16 <DD>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: &quot;I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>17 <DD>&quot;Therefore come out from them and be separate,  says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>&quot;I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,  says the Lord Almighty.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207350703_5">5</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_207350703_1">[2] Isaiah 49:8</A></LI>
