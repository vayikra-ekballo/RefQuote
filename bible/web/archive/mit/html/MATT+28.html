</DL><B>Matthew 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.<DT>2 <DD>There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.<DT>3 <DD>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.<DT>4 <DD>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.<DT>5 <DD>The angel said to the women, &quot;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.<DT>6 <DD>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.<DT>7 <DD>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: `He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.&quot;<DT>8 <DD>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.<DT>9 <DD>Suddenly Jesus met them. &quot;Greetings,&quot; he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.<DT>10 <DD>Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.<DT>12 <DD>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,<DT>13 <DD>telling them, &quot;You are to say, `His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'<DT>14 <DD>If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.<DT>16 <DD>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.<DT>17 <DD>When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.<DT>18 <DD>Then Jesus came to them and said, &quot;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.<DT>19 <DD>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_176146340_1">1</a>]</sup>   the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<DT>20 <DD>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_176146340_1">[19] Or <I>into</I>; see Acts 8:16; 19:5; Romans 6:3; 1 Cor. 1:13; 10:2 and Gal. 3:27.</A></LI>
