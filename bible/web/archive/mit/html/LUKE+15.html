</DL><B>Luke 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now the tax collectors and &quot;sinners&quot; were all gathering around to hear him.<DT>2 <DD>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, &quot;This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then Jesus told them this parable:<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?<DT>5 <DD>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders<DT>6 <DD>and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'<DT>7 <DD>I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.<DT>8 <DD>&quot;Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_1">1</a>]</sup>   and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?<DT>9 <DD>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, `Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'<DT>10 <DD>In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Jesus continued: &quot;There was a man who had two sons.<DT>12 <DD>The younger one said to his father, `Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.<DT>14 <DD>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.<DT>15 <DD>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<DT>16 <DD>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;When he came to his senses, he said, `How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!<DT>18 <DD>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<DT>19 <DD>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.'<DT>20 <DD>So he got up and went to his father. &quot;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;The son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_2">2</a>]</sup>  '<DT>22 <DD>&quot;But the father said to his servants, `Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<DT>23 <DD>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.<DT>24 <DD>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.<DT>26 <DD>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.<DT>27 <DD>`Your brother has come,' he replied, `and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'<DT>28 <DD>&quot;The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.<DT>29 <DD>But he answered his father, `Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.<DT>30 <DD>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'<DT>31 <DD>&quot;`My son,' the father said, `you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.<DT>32 <DD>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_185346099_1">[8] Greek <I>ten drachmas,</I> each worth about a day's wages</A></LI>
