</DL><B>Proverbs 20</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler; whoever is led astray by them is not wise. <DT>2 <DD>A king's wrath is like the roar of a lion; he who angers him forfeits his life. <DT>3 <DD>It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel. <DT>4 <DD>A sluggard does not plow in season; so at harvest time he looks but finds nothing. <DT>5 <DD>The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out. <DT>6 <DD>Many a man claims to have unfailing love, but a faithful man who can find? <DT>7 <DD>The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him. <DT>8 <DD>When a king sits on his throne to judge, he winnows out all evil with his eyes. <DT>9 <DD>Who can say, &quot;I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without sin&quot;? <DT>10 <DD>Differing weights and differing measures-- the LORD detests them both. <DT>11 <DD>Even a child is known by his actions, by whether his conduct is pure and right. <DT>12 <DD>Ears that hear and eyes that see-- the LORD has made them both. <DT>13 <DD>Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;It's no good, it's no good!&quot; says the buyer; then off he goes and boasts about his purchase. <DT>15 <DD>Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel. <DT>16 <DD>Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman. <DT>17 <DD>Food gained by fraud tastes sweet to a man, but he ends up with a mouth full of gravel. <DT>18 <DD>Make plans by seeking advice; if you wage war, obtain guidance. <DT>19 <DD>A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid a man who talks too much. <DT>20 <DD>If a man curses his father or mother, his lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness. <DT>21 <DD>An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning will not be blessed at the end. <DT>22 <DD>Do not say, &quot;I'll pay you back for this wrong!&quot; Wait for the LORD, and he will deliver you. <DT>23 <DD>The LORD detests differing weights, and dishonest scales do not please him. <DT>24 <DD>A man's steps are directed by the LORD. How then can anyone understand his own way? <DT>25 <DD>It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider his vows. <DT>26 <DD>A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them. <DT>27 <DD>The lamp of the LORD searches the spirit of a man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_117158154_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; it searches out his inmost being. <DT>28 <DD>Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure. <DT>29 <DD>The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old. <DT>30 <DD>Blows and wounds cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_117158154_1">[27] Or <I>The spirit of man is the LORD's lamp</I></A></LI>
