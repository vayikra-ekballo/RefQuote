</DL><B>Psalm 48</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 48  A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah.<DT>1 <DD>Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.<DT>2 <DD>It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_1">1</a>]</sup>   is Mount Zion, the <sup>[<a href="#footnote_123880395_2">2</a>]</sup>   city of the Great King.<DT>3 <DD>God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress. <DT>4 <DD>When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,<DT>5 <DD>they saw [her] and were astounded; they fled in terror.<DT>6 <DD>Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.<DT>7 <DD>You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind. <DT>8 <DD>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever.  Selah <DT>9 <DD>Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.<DT>10 <DD>Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.<DT>11 <DD>Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments. <DT>12 <DD>Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,<DT>13 <DD>consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.<DT>14 <DD>For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_123880395_1">[2] <I>Zaphon</I> can refer to a sacred mountain or the direction north.</A></LI>
