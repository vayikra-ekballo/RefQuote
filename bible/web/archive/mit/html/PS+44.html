</DL><B>Psalm 44</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 44  For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>1 <DD>We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.<DT>2 <DD>With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.<DT>3 <DD>It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them. <DT>4 <DD>You are my King and my God, who decrees <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_2">2</a>]</sup>   victories for Jacob.<DT>5 <DD>Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.<DT>6 <DD>I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;<DT>7 <DD>but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.<DT>8 <DD>In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah <DT>9 <DD>But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.<DT>10 <DD>You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.<DT>11 <DD>You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.<DT>12 <DD>You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale. <DT>13 <DD>You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.<DT>14 <DD>You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.<DT>15 <DD>My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame<DT>16 <DD>at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge. <DT>17 <DD>All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.<DT>18 <DD>Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.<DT>19 <DD>But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness. <DT>20 <DD>If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,<DT>21 <DD>would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?<DT>22 <DD>Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. <DT>23 <DD>Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.<DT>24 <DD>Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression? <DT>25 <DD>We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.<DT>26 <DD>Rise up and help us; redeem us because of your unfailing love. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305435809_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
