</DL><B>Proverbs 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD; he directs it like a watercourse wherever he pleases. <DT>2 <DD>All a man's ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart. <DT>3 <DD>To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. <DT>4 <DD>Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin! <DT>5 <DD>The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty. <DT>6 <DD>A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_851394498_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>7 <DD>The violence of the wicked will drag them away, for they refuse to do what is right. <DT>8 <DD>The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright. <DT>9 <DD>Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. <DT>10 <DD>The wicked man craves evil; his neighbor gets no mercy from him. <DT>11 <DD>When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; when a wise man is instructed, he gets knowledge. <DT>12 <DD>The Righteous One <sup>[<a href="#footnote_851394498_2">2</a>]</sup>   takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin. <DT>13 <DD>If a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered. <DT>14 <DD>A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. <DT>15 <DD>When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. <DT>16 <DD>A man who strays from the path of understanding comes to rest in the company of the dead. <DT>17 <DD>He who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich. <DT>18 <DD>The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright. <DT>19 <DD>Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and ill-tempered wife. <DT>20 <DD>In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has. <DT>21 <DD>He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity <sup>[<a href="#footnote_851394498_3">3</a>]</sup>   and honor. <DT>22 <DD>A wise man attacks the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust. <DT>23 <DD>He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity. <DT>24 <DD>The proud and arrogant man--&quot;Mocker&quot; is his name; he behaves with overweening pride. <DT>25 <DD>The sluggard's craving will be the death of him, because his hands refuse to work.<DT>26 <DD>All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing. <DT>27 <DD>The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable-- how much more so when brought with evil intent! <DT>28 <DD>A false witness will perish, and whoever listens to him will be destroyed forever. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_851394498_4">4</a>]</sup>   <DT>29 <DD>A wicked man puts up a bold front, but an upright man gives thought to his ways. <DT>30 <DD>There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD. <DT>31 <DD>The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_851394498_1">[6] Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts <I>vapor for those who seek death</I></A></LI>
