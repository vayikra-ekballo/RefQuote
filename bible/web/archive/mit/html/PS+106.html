</DL><B>Psalm 106</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 106 <DT>1 <DD>Praise the LORD. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_1">1</a>]</sup>    Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.<DT>2 <DD>Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?<DT>3 <DD>Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.<DT>4 <DD>Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,<DT>5 <DD>that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. <DT>6 <DD>We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.<DT>7 <DD>When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.<DT>9 <DD>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.<DT>10 <DD>He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.<DT>11 <DD>The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.<DT>12 <DD>Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. <DT>13 <DD>But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.<DT>14 <DD>In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.<DT>15 <DD>So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. <DT>16 <DD>In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.<DT>17 <DD>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.<DT>18 <DD>Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked. <DT>19 <DD>At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.<DT>20 <DD>They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.<DT>21 <DD>They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,<DT>22 <DD>miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.<DT>23 <DD>So he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them. <DT>24 <DD>Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.<DT>25 <DD>They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.<DT>26 <DD>So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,<DT>27 <DD>make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. <DT>28 <DD>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;<DT>29 <DD>they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.<DT>30 <DD>But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.<DT>31 <DD>This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. <DT>32 <DD>By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;<DT>33 <DD>for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185804240_3">3</a>]</sup>   <DT>34 <DD>They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,<DT>35 <DD>but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.<DT>36 <DD>They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.<DT>37 <DD>They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<DT>38 <DD>They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.<DT>39 <DD>They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves. <DT>40 <DD>Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.<DT>41 <DD>He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.<DT>42 <DD>Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.<DT>43 <DD>Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin. <DT>44 <DD>But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;<DT>45 <DD>for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.<DT>46 <DD>He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive. <DT>47 <DD>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. <DT>48 <DD>Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, &quot;Amen!&quot;  Praise the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_185804240_1">[1] Hebrew <I>Hallelu Yah</I>; also in verse 48</A></LI>
