</DL><B>Isaiah 63</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength?  &quot;It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.&quot; <DT>2 <DD>Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? <DT>3 <DD>&quot;I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.<DT>4 <DD>For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come.<DT>5 <DD>I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.<DT>6 <DD>I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.&quot; <DT>7 <DD>I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the LORD has done for us-- yes, the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses.<DT>8 <DD>He said, &quot;Surely they are my people, sons who will not be false to me&quot;; and so he became their Savior.<DT>9 <DD>In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.<DT>10 <DD>Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. <DT>11 <DD>Then his people recalled <sup>[<a href="#footnote_53237526_1">1</a>]</sup>   the days of old, the days of Moses and his people-- where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them,<DT>12 <DD>who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses' right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown,<DT>13 <DD>who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;<DT>14 <DD>like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name. <DT>15 <DD>Look down from heaven and see from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.<DT>16 <DD>But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.<DT>17 <DD>Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.<DT>18 <DD>For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.<DT>19 <DD>We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_53237526_2">2</a>]</sup>   </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_53237526_1">[11] Or <I>But may he recall</I></A></LI>
