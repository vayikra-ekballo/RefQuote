</DL><B>John 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<DT>2 <DD>He was with God in the beginning.<DT>3 <DD>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.<DT>4 <DD>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.<DT>5 <DD>The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_1">1</a>]</sup>   it.<DT>6 <DD>There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.<DT>7 <DD>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.<DT>8 <DD>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.<DT>9 <DD>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>10 <DD>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.<DT>11 <DD>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.<DT>12 <DD>Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--<DT>13 <DD>children born not of natural descent, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_3">3</a>]</sup>   nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.<DT>14 <DD>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_4">4</a>]</sup>   who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<DT>15 <DD>John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, &quot;This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'&quot;<DT>16 <DD>From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.<DT>17 <DD>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<DT>18 <DD>No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_5">5</a>]</sup>    <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_6">6</a>]</sup>   who is at the Father's side, has made him known.<DT>19 <DD>Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.<DT>20 <DD>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, &quot;I am not the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_7">7</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>21 <DD>They asked him, &quot;Then who are you? Are you Elijah?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; He answered, &quot;No.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Finally they said, &quot;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&quot;<DT>23 <DD>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, &quot;I am the voice of one calling in the desert, `Make straight the way for the Lord.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_8">8</a>]</sup>  <DT>24 <DD>Now some Pharisees who had been sent<DT>25 <DD>questioned him, &quot;Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&quot;<DT>26 <DD>&quot;I baptize with <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_9">9</a>]</sup>   water,&quot; John replied, &quot;but among you stands one you do not know.<DT>27 <DD>He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<DT>29 <DD>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!<DT>30 <DD>This is the one I meant when I said, `A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'<DT>31 <DD>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>Then John gave this testimony: &quot;I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.<DT>33 <DD>I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, `The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'<DT>34 <DD>I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.&quot;<DT>35 <DD>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.<DT>36 <DD>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God!&quot;<DT>37 <DD>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.<DT>38 <DD>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot; They said, &quot;Rabbi&quot; (which means Teacher), &quot;where are you staying?&quot;<DT>39 <DD>&quot;Come,&quot; he replied, &quot;and you will see.&quot; So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.<DT>40 <DD>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.<DT>41 <DD>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (that is, the Christ).<DT>42 <DD>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas&quot; (which, when translated, is Peter <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_10">10</a>]</sup>  ).<DT>43 <DD>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot;<DT>44 <DD>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.<DT>45 <DD>Philip found Nathanael and told him, &quot;We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot;<DT>46 <DD>&quot;Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?&quot; Nathanael asked. &quot;Come and see,&quot; said Philip.<DT>47 <DD>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, &quot;Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.&quot;<DT>48 <DD>&quot;How do you know me?&quot; Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.&quot;<DT>49 <DD>Then Nathanael declared, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;<DT>50 <DD>Jesus said, &quot;You believe <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_11">11</a>]</sup>   because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.&quot;<DT>51 <DD>He then added, &quot;I tell you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_12">12</a>]</sup>   the truth, you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_134516985_13">13</a>]</sup>   shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_134516985_1">[5] Or <I>darkness, and the darkness has not overcome</I></A></LI>
