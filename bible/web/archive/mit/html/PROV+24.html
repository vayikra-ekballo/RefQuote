</DL><B>Proverbs 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Do not envy wicked men, do not desire their company;<DT>2 <DD>for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble. <DT>3 <DD>By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established;<DT>4 <DD>through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures. <DT>5 <DD>A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength;<DT>6 <DD>for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers. <DT>7 <DD>Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the assembly at the gate he has nothing to say. <DT>8 <DD>He who plots evil will be known as a schemer.<DT>9 <DD>The schemes of folly are sin, and men detest a mocker. <DT>10 <DD>If you falter in times of trouble, how small is your strength! <DT>11 <DD>Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.<DT>12 <DD>If you say, &quot;But we knew nothing about this,&quot; does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? <DT>13 <DD>Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.<DT>14 <DD>Know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul; if you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. <DT>15 <DD>Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous man's house, do not raid his dwelling place;<DT>16 <DD>for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity. <DT>17 <DD>Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice,<DT>18 <DD>or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him. <DT>19 <DD>Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked,<DT>20 <DD>for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <DT>21 <DD>Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious,<DT>22 <DD>for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring?<DT>23 <DD>These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good:<DT>24 <DD>Whoever says to the guilty, &quot;You are innocent&quot;-- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him.<DT>25 <DD>But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. <DT>26 <DD>An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. <DT>27 <DD>Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house. <DT>28 <DD>Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive.<DT>29 <DD>Do not say, &quot;I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did.&quot; <DT>30 <DD>I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment;<DT>31 <DD>thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.<DT>32 <DD>I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw:<DT>33 <DD>A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--<DT>34 <DD>and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_102521333_1">1</a>]</sup>  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_102521333_1">[34] Or <I>like a vagrant / and scarcity like a beggar</I></A></LI>
