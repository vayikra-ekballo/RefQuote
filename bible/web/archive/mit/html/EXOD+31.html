</DL><B>Exodus 31</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the LORD said to Moses,<DT>2 <DD>&quot;See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,<DT>3 <DD>and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts--<DT>4 <DD>to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,<DT>5 <DD>to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.<DT>6 <DD>Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to help him. Also I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you:<DT>7 <DD>the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it, and all the other furnishings of the tent--<DT>8 <DD>the table and its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,<DT>9 <DD>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand--<DT>10 <DD>and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,<DT>11 <DD>and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Then the LORD said to Moses,<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Say to the Israelites, `You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_515943273_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>&quot;`Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.<DT>15 <DD>For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.<DT>16 <DD>The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.<DT>17 <DD>It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.'&quot;<DT>18 <DD>When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_515943273_1">[13] Or <I>who sanctifies you</I>; or <I>who sets you apart as holy</I></A></LI>
