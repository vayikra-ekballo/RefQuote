</DL><B>2 Samuel 18</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.<DT>2 <DD>David sent the troops out--a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, &quot;I myself will surely march out with you.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>But the men said, &quot;You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_1">1</a>]</sup>   It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>The king answered, &quot;I will do whatever seems best to you.&quot; So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.<DT>5 <DD>The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, &quot;Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.&quot; And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.<DT>6 <DD>The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.<DT>7 <DD>There the army of Israel was defeated by David's men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.<DT>8 <DD>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.<DT>9 <DD>Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.<DT>10 <DD>When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, &quot;I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Joab said to the man who had told him this, &quot;What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_2">2</a>]</sup>   of silver and a warrior's belt.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>But the man replied, &quot;Even if a thousand shekels <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_3">3</a>]</sup>   were weighed out into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, `Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_4">4</a>]</sup>  '<DT>13 <DD>And if I had put my life in jeopardy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_5">5</a>]</sup>  --and nothing is hidden from the king--you would have kept your distance from me.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Joab said, &quot;I'm not going to wait like this for you.&quot; So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.<DT>15 <DD>And ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.<DT>16 <DD>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.<DT>17 <DD>They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.<DT>18 <DD>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, &quot;I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.&quot; He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.<DT>19 <DD>Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, &quot;Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>&quot;You are not the one to take the news today,&quot; Joab told him. &quot;You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king's son is dead.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>Then Joab said to a Cushite, &quot;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&quot; The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.<DT>22 <DD>Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, &quot;Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.&quot; But Joab replied, &quot;My son, why do you want to go? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>He said, &quot;Come what may, I want to run.&quot; So Joab said, &quot;Run!&quot; Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain <sup>[<a href="#footnote_410585287_6">6</a>]</sup>   and outran the Cushite.<DT>24 <DD>While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.<DT>25 <DD>The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, &quot;If he is alone, he must have good news.&quot; And the man came closer and closer.<DT>26 <DD>Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, &quot;Look, another man running alone!&quot; The king said, &quot;He must be bringing good news, too.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>The watchman said, &quot;It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.&quot; &quot;He's a good man,&quot; the king said. &quot;He comes with good news.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, &quot;All is well!&quot; He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, &quot;Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king.&quot;<DT>29 <DD>The king asked, &quot;Is the young man Absalom safe?&quot; Ahimaaz answered, &quot;I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>The king said, &quot;Stand aside and wait here.&quot; So he stepped aside and stood there.<DT>31 <DD>Then the Cushite arrived and said, &quot;My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>The king asked the Cushite, &quot;Is the young man Absalom safe?&quot; The Cushite replied, &quot;May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: &quot;O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_410585287_1">[3] Two Hebrew manuscripts, some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts <I>care; for now there are ten thousand like us</I></A></LI>
