</DL><B>Amos 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Hear this word the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel--against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?<DT>4 <DD>Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?<DT>5 <DD>Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?<DT>6 <DD>When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?<DT>7 <DD>Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.<DT>8 <DD>The lion has roared-- who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken-- who can but prophesy?<DT>9 <DD>Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: &quot;Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>&quot;They do not know how to do right,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;who hoard plunder and loot in their fortresses.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: &quot;An enemy will overrun the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;As a shepherd saves from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites be saved, those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>13 <DD>&quot;Hear this and testify against the house of Jacob,&quot; declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty.<DT>14 <DD>&quot;On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.<DT>15 <DD>I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished,&quot; declares the LORD.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_152113421_1">[12] The meaning of the Hebrew for this line is uncertain.</A></LI>
