Come! Flee from the land of the north,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,&quot; declares the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;Come, O Zion! Escape, you who live in the Daughter of Babylon!&quot;<DT>8 <DD>For this is what the LORD Almighty says: &quot;After he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered you--for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye--<DT>9 <DD>I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_430775305_1">1</a>]</sup>   Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;Shout and be glad, O Daughter of Zion.
