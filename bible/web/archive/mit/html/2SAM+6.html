</DL><B>2 Samuel 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all.<DT>2 <DD>He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_1">1</a>]</sup>   to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_2">2</a>]</sup>   the name of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark.<DT>3 <DD>They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart<DT>4 <DD>with the ark of God on it, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_3">3</a>]</sup>   and Ahio was walking in front of it.<DT>5 <DD>David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with songs <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_4">4</a>]</sup>   and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals.<DT>6 <DD>When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.<DT>7 <DD>The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God.<DT>8 <DD>Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, &quot;How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?&quot;<DT>10 <DD>He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.<DT>11 <DD>The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household.<DT>12 <DD>Now King David was told, &quot;The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.&quot; So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing.<DT>13 <DD>When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.<DT>14 <DD>David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might,<DT>15 <DD>while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets.<DT>16 <DD>As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart.<DT>17 <DD>They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_190273437_6">6</a>]</sup>   before the LORD.<DT>18 <DD>After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty.<DT>19 <DD>Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.<DT>20 <DD>When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, &quot;How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!&quot;<DT>21 <DD>David said to Michal, &quot;It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD's people Israel--I will celebrate before the LORD.<DT>22 <DD>I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_190273437_1">[2] That is, Kiriath Jearim; Hebrew <I>Baale Judah</I>, a variant of <I>Baalah of Judah</I></A></LI>
