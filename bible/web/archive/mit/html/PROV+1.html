</DL><B>Proverbs 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:<DT>2 <DD>for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;<DT>3 <DD>for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;<DT>4 <DD>for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--<DT>5 <DD>let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance--<DT>6 <DD>for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. <DT>7 <DD>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_1">1</a>]</sup>   despise wisdom and discipline. <DT>8 <DD>Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.<DT>9 <DD>They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. <DT>10 <DD>My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.<DT>11 <DD>If they say, &quot;Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;<DT>12 <DD>let's swallow them alive, like the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_2">2</a>]</sup>   and whole, like those who go down to the pit;<DT>13 <DD>we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;<DT>14 <DD>throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse&quot;--<DT>15 <DD>my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;<DT>16 <DD>for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.<DT>17 <DD>How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!<DT>18 <DD>These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!<DT>19 <DD>Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it. <DT>20 <DD>Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;<DT>21 <DD>at the head of the noisy streets <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_3">3</a>]</sup>   she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech: <DT>22 <DD>&quot;How long will you simple ones <sup>[<a href="#footnote_156996348_4">4</a>]</sup>   love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?<DT>23 <DD>If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.<DT>24 <DD>But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,<DT>25 <DD>since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,<DT>26 <DD>I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you--<DT>27 <DD>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. <DT>28 <DD>&quot;Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.<DT>29 <DD>Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,<DT>30 <DD>since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,<DT>31 <DD>they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.<DT>32 <DD>For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;<DT>33 <DD>but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_156996348_1">[7] The Hebrew words rendered <I>fool</I> in Proverbs, and often elsewhere in the Old Testament, denote one who is morally deficient.</A></LI>
