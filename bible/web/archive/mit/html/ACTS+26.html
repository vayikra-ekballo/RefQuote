</DL><B>Acts 26</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Agrippa said to Paul, &quot;You have permission to speak for yourself.&quot; So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,<DT>3 <DD>and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.<DT>5 <DD>They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.<DT>6 <DD>And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.<DT>7 <DD>This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.<DT>8 <DD>Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?<DT>9 <DD>&quot;I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.<DT>10 <DD>And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.<DT>11 <DD>Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.<DT>12 <DD>&quot;On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.<DT>13 <DD>About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.<DT>14 <DD>We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_1">1</a>]</sup>   `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'<DT>15 <DD>&quot;Then I asked, `Who are you, Lord?' &quot;`I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.<DT>16 <DD>`Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.<DT>17 <DD>I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them<DT>18 <DD>to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'<DT>19 <DD>&quot;So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.<DT>20 <DD>First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.<DT>21 <DD>That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.<DT>22 <DD>But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--<DT>23 <DD>that the Christ <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_2">2</a>]</sup>   would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. &quot;You are out of your mind, Paul!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Your great learning is driving you insane.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>&quot;I am not insane, most excellent Festus,&quot; Paul replied. &quot;What I am saying is true and reasonable.<DT>26 <DD>The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.<DT>27 <DD>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Then Agrippa said to Paul, &quot;Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?&quot;<DT>29 <DD>Paul replied, &quot;Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.<DT>31 <DD>They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, &quot;This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>Agrippa said to Festus, &quot;This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_141380071_1">[14] Or <I>Hebrew</I></A></LI>
