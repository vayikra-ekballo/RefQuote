When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.<DT>1 <DD>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.<DT>2 <DD>Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. <DT>3 <DD>For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.<DT>4 <DD>Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.<DT>5 <DD>Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.<DT>6 <DD>Surely you desire truth in the inner parts <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; you teach <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_2">2</a>]</sup>   me wisdom in the inmost place. <DT>7 <DD>Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.<DT>8 <DD>Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.<DT>9 <DD>Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. <DT>10 <DD>Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.<DT>11 <DD>Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.<DT>12 <DD>Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. <DT>13 <DD>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.<DT>14 <DD>Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.<DT>15 <DD>O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.<DT>16 <DD>You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.<DT>17 <DD>The sacrifices of God are <sup>[<a href="#footnote_333476998_3">3</a>]</sup>   a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. <DT>18 <DD>In your good pleasure make Zion prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.<DT>19 <DD>Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you; then bulls will be offered on your altar. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_333476998_1">[6] The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.</A></LI>
