</DL><B>Song of Solomon 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink your fill, O lovers.<DT>2 <DD>I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking: &quot;Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>I have taken off my robe-- must I put it on again? I have washed my feet-- must I soil them again?<DT>4 <DD>My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.<DT>5 <DD>I arose to open for my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.<DT>6 <DD>I opened for my lover, but my lover had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_928170070_1">1</a>]</sup>   I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.<DT>7 <DD>The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!<DT>8 <DD>O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you-- if you find my lover, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.<DT>9 <DD>How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you charge us so?<DT>10 <DD>My lover is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.<DT>11 <DD>His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.<DT>12 <DD>His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.<DT>13 <DD>His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.<DT>14 <DD>His arms are rods of gold set with chrysolite. His body is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_928170070_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>15 <DD>His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.<DT>16 <DD>His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my lover, this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_928170070_1">[6] Or <I>heart had gone out to him when he spoke</I></A></LI>
