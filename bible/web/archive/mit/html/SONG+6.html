</DL><B>Song of Solomon 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Where has your lover gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your lover turn, that we may look for him with you?<DT>2 <DD>My lover has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.<DT>3 <DD>I am my lover's and my lover is mine; he browses among the lilies.<DT>4 <DD>You are beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as troops with banners.<DT>5 <DD>Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.<DT>6 <DD>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is alone.<DT>7 <DD>Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.<DT>8 <DD>Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number;<DT>9 <DD>but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.<DT>10 <DD>Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?<DT>11 <DD>I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.<DT>12 <DD>Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_169500052_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>13 <DD>Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you!
