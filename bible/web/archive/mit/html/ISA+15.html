</DL><B>Isaiah 15</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An oracle concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!<DT>2 <DD>Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.<DT>3 <DD>In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping.<DT>4 <DD>Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint. <DT>5 <DD>My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.<DT>6 <DD>The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.<DT>7 <DD>So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.<DT>8 <DD>Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.<DT>9 <DD>Dimon's <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_1">1</a>]</sup>   waters are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon <sup>[<a href="#footnote_690230324_2">2</a>]</sup>  -- a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_690230324_1">[9] Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls, some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate <I>Dibon</I></A></LI>
