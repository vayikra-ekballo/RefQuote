</DL><B>Revelation 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, &quot;Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.<DT>3 <DD>And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.<DT>4 <DD>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.<DT>5 <DD>From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits <sup>[<a href="#footnote_238916283_1">1</a>]</sup>   of God.<DT>6 <DD>Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.<DT>7 <DD>The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.<DT>8 <DD>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying:  &quot;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,<DT>10 <DD>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: <DT>11 <DD>&quot;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_238916283_1">[5] Or <I>the sevenfold Spirit</I></A></LI>
