</DL><B>Isaiah 23</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>An oracle concerning Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_1">1</a>]</sup>   word has come to them. <DT>2 <DD>Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.<DT>3 <DD>On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_2">2</a>]</sup>   was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations. <DT>4 <DD>Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken: &quot;I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre. <DT>6 <DD>Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.<DT>7 <DD>Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?<DT>8 <DD>Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?<DT>9 <DD>The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth. <DT>10 <DD>Till <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_3">3</a>]</sup>   your land as along the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.<DT>11 <DD>The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_4">4</a>]</sup>   that her fortresses be destroyed.<DT>12 <DD>He said, &quot;No more of your reveling, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon, now crushed!  &quot;Up, cross over to Cyprus <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_5">5</a>]</sup>  ; even there you will find no rest.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Look at the land of the Babylonians, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148254904_6">6</a>]</sup>   this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin. <DT>14 <DD>Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!<DT>15 <DD>At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:<DT>16 <DD>&quot;Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.<DT>18 <DD>Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_148254904_1">[1,12] Hebrew <I>Kittim</I></A></LI>
