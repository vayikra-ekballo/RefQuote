</DL><B>Jeremiah 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people.<DT>2 <DD>Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, so that I might leave my people and go away from them; for they are all adulterers, a crowd of unfaithful people. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;They make ready their tongue like a bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they triumph <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup>   in the land. They go from one sin to another; they do not acknowledge me,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;Beware of your friends; do not trust your brothers. For every brother is a deceiver, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_2">2</a>]</sup>   and every friend a slanderer.<DT>5 <DD>Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they weary themselves with sinning.<DT>6 <DD>You <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_3">3</a>]</sup>   live in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: &quot;See, I will refine and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people?<DT>8 <DD>Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks with deceit. With his mouth each speaks cordially to his neighbor, but in his heart he sets a trap for him.<DT>9 <DD>Should I not punish them for this?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?&quot; <DT>10 <DD>I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the desert pastures. They are desolate and untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds of the air have fled and the animals are gone. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>What man is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?<DT>13 <DD>The LORD said, &quot;It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law.<DT>14 <DD>Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their fathers taught them.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &quot;See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.<DT>16 <DD>I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have destroyed them.&quot; <DT>17 <DD>This is what the LORD Almighty says: &quot;Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; send for the most skillful of them.<DT>18 <DD>Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids.<DT>19 <DD>The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: `How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins.'&quot; <DT>20 <DD>Now, O women, hear the word of the LORD; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach one another a lament.<DT>21 <DD>Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has cut off the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.<DT>22 <DD>Say, &quot;This is what the LORD declares: &quot;`The dead bodies of men will lie like refuse on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.'&quot;<DT>23 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches,<DT>24 <DD>but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,&quot;  declares the LORD.<DT>25 <DD>&quot;The days are coming,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh--<DT>26 <DD>Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the desert in distant places. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_4">4</a>]</sup>   For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_129182958_1">[3] Or <I>lies; / they are not valiant for truth</I></A></LI>
