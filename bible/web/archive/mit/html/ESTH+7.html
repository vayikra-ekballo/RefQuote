</DL><B>Esther 7</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther,<DT>2 <DD>and as they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again asked, &quot;Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then Queen Esther answered, &quot;If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life--this is my petition. And spare my people--this is my request.<DT>4 <DD>For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_1">1</a>]</sup>  &quot;<DT>5 <DD>King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, &quot;Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Esther said, &quot;The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman.&quot; Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.<DT>7 <DD>The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.<DT>8 <DD>Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, &quot;Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?&quot; As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.<DT>9 <DD>Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, &quot;A gallows seventy-five feet <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124154384_2">2</a>]</sup>   high stands by Haman's house. He had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king.&quot; The king said, &quot;Hang him on it!&quot;<DT>10 <DD>So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_124154384_1">[4] Or <I>quiet, but the compensation our adversary offers cannot be compared with the loss the king would suffer</I></A></LI>
