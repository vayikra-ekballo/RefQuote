</DL><B>Genesis 32</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.<DT>2 <DD>When Jacob saw them, he said, &quot;This is the camp of God!&quot; So he named that place Mahanaim. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.<DT>4 <DD>He instructed them: &quot;This is what you are to say to my master Esau: `Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.<DT>5 <DD>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'&quot;<DT>6 <DD>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, &quot;We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&quot;<DT>7 <DD>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_2">2</a>]</sup>   and the flocks and herds and camels as well.<DT>8 <DD>He thought, &quot;If Esau comes and attacks one group, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_3">3</a>]</sup>   the group <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_4">4</a>]</sup>   that is left may escape.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Then Jacob prayed, &quot;O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, `Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'<DT>10 <DD>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.<DT>11 <DD>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.<DT>12 <DD>But you have said, `I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'&quot;<DT>13 <DD>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:<DT>14 <DD>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,<DT>15 <DD>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.<DT>16 <DD>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, &quot;Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>He instructed the one in the lead: &quot;When my brother Esau meets you and asks, `To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'<DT>18 <DD>then you are to say, `They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'&quot;<DT>19 <DD>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: &quot;You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.<DT>20 <DD>And be sure to say, `Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'&quot; For he thought, &quot;I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.<DT>22 <DD>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.<DT>23 <DD>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.<DT>24 <DD>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.<DT>25 <DD>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.<DT>26 <DD>Then the man said, &quot;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob replied, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>The man asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered.<DT>28 <DD>Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_5">5</a>]</sup>   because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.&quot;<DT>29 <DD>Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your name.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot; Then he blessed him there.<DT>30 <DD>So Jacob called the place Peniel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_6">6</a>]</sup>   saying, &quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.&quot;<DT>31 <DD>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_720658957_7">7</a>]</sup>   and he was limping because of his hip.<DT>32 <DD>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_720658957_1">[2] <I>Mahanaim</I> means <I>two camps.</I></A></LI>
