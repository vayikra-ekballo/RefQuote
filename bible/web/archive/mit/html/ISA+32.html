</DL><B>Isaiah 32</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.<DT>2 <DD>Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land. <DT>3 <DD>Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.<DT>4 <DD>The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.<DT>5 <DD>No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.<DT>6 <DD>For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil: He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.<DT>7 <DD>The scoundrel's methods are wicked, he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.<DT>8 <DD>But the noble man makes noble plans, and by noble deeds he stands. <DT>9 <DD>You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say!<DT>10 <DD>In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come.<DT>11 <DD>Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your clothes, put sackcloth around your waists.<DT>12 <DD>Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines<DT>13 <DD>and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers-- yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.<DT>14 <DD>The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,<DT>15 <DD>till the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest.<DT>16 <DD>Justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field.<DT>17 <DD>The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.<DT>18 <DD>My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.<DT>19 <DD>Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,<DT>20 <DD>how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free. </DL><OL></OL>
