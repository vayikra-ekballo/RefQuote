</DL><B>Hebrews 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.<DT>2 <DD>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, &quot;So I declared on oath in my anger, `They shall never enter my rest.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_2">2</a>]</sup>   And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.<DT>4 <DD>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: &quot;And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>And again in the passage above he says, &quot;They shall never enter my rest.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.<DT>7 <DD>Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: &quot;Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.<DT>9 <DD>There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;<DT>10 <DD>for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.<DT>11 <DD>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.<DT>12 <DD>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.<DT>13 <DD>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.<DT>14 <DD>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185183196_5">5</a>]</sup>   Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.<DT>15 <DD>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.<DT>16 <DD>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_185183196_1">[2] Many manuscripts <I>because they did not share in the faith of those who obeyed</I></A></LI>
