</DL><B>Psalm 31</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 31  For the director of music. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame; deliver me in your righteousness.<DT>2 <DD>Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me.<DT>3 <DD>Since you are my rock and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me.<DT>4 <DD>Free me from the trap that is set for me, for you are my refuge.<DT>5 <DD>Into your hands I commit my spirit; redeem me, O LORD, the God of truth. <DT>6 <DD>I hate those who cling to worthless idols; I trust in the LORD.<DT>7 <DD>I will be glad and rejoice in your love, for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.<DT>8 <DD>You have not handed me over to the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place. <DT>9 <DD>Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes grow weak with sorrow, my soul and my body with grief.<DT>10 <DD>My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning; my strength fails because of my affliction, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_211693759_1">1</a>]</sup>   and my bones grow weak.<DT>11 <DD>Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors; I am a dread to my friends-- those who see me on the street flee from me.<DT>12 <DD>I am forgotten by them as though I were dead; I have become like broken pottery.<DT>13 <DD>For I hear the slander of many; there is terror on every side; they conspire against me and plot to take my life. <DT>14 <DD>But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, &quot;You are my God.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>My times are in your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.<DT>16 <DD>Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love.<DT>17 <DD>Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and lie silent in the grave. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_211693759_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous. <DT>19 <DD>How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you, which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you.<DT>20 <DD>In the shelter of your presence you hide them from the intrigues of men; in your dwelling you keep them safe from accusing tongues. <DT>21 <DD>Praise be to the LORD, for he showed his wonderful love to me when I was in a besieged city.<DT>22 <DD>In my alarm I said, &quot;I am cut off from your sight!&quot; Yet you heard my cry for mercy when I called to you for help. <DT>23 <DD>Love the LORD, all his saints! The LORD preserves the faithful, but the proud he pays back in full.<DT>24 <DD>Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_211693759_1">[10] Or <I>guilt</I></A></LI>
