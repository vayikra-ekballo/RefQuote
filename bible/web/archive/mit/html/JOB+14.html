</DL><B>Job 14</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.<DT>2 <DD>He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.<DT>3 <DD>Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_1">1</a>]</sup>   before you for judgment?<DT>4 <DD>Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!<DT>5 <DD>Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.<DT>6 <DD>So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.<DT>8 <DD>Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,<DT>9 <DD>yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.<DT>10 <DD>But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.<DT>11 <DD>As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,<DT>12 <DD>so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;If only you would hide me in the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_2">2</a>]</sup>   and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!<DT>14 <DD>If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_161036874_3">3</a>]</sup>   to come.<DT>15 <DD>You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.<DT>16 <DD>Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.<DT>17 <DD>My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,<DT>19 <DD>as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.<DT>20 <DD>You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.<DT>21 <DD>If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.<DT>22 <DD>He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_161036874_1">[3] Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew <I>me</I></A></LI>
