</DL><B>Isaiah 8</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to me, &quot;Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>2 <DD>And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, &quot;Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.<DT>4 <DD>Before the boy knows how to say `My father' or `My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.&quot;<DT>5 <DD>The LORD spoke to me again:<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,<DT>7 <DD>therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_2">2</a>]</sup>  -- the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks<DT>8 <DD>and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_3">3</a>]</sup>  !&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Raise the war cry, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_4">4</a>]</sup>   you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!<DT>10 <DD>Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>11 <DD>The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said:<DT>12 <DD>&quot;Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy <sup>[<a href="#footnote_174971231_6">6</a>]</sup>  ; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.<DT>13 <DD>The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,<DT>14 <DD>and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.<DT>15 <DD>Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured.&quot; <DT>16 <DD>Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.<DT>17 <DD>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.<DT>18 <DD>Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.<DT>19 <DD>When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?<DT>20 <DD>To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.<DT>21 <DD>Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.<DT>22 <DD>Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_174971231_1">[1] <I>Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz</I> means <I>quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil</I>; also in verse 3.</A></LI>
