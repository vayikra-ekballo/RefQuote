</DL><B>Genesis 16</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;<DT>2 <DD>so she said to Abram, &quot;The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her.&quot; Abram agreed to what Sarai said.<DT>3 <DD>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.<DT>4 <DD>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.<DT>5 <DD>Then Sarai said to Abram, &quot;You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Your servant is in your hands,&quot; Abram said. &quot;Do with her whatever you think best.&quot; Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.<DT>7 <DD>The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.<DT>8 <DD>And he said, &quot;Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?&quot; &quot;I'm running away from my mistress Sarai,&quot; she answered.<DT>9 <DD>Then the angel of the LORD told her, &quot;Go back to your mistress and submit to her.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>The angel added, &quot;I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>The angel of the LORD also said to her: &quot;You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael,<sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_1">1</a>]</sup>  for the LORD has heard of your misery.<DT>12 <DD>He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward<sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_2">2</a>]</sup>  all his brothers.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: &quot;You are the God who sees me,&quot; for she said, &quot;I have now seen<sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_3">3</a>]</sup>  the One who sees me.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi<sup>[<a href="#footnote_129182958_4">4</a>]</sup> ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.<DT>15 <DD>So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.<DT>16 <DD>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_129182958_1">[11] <I>Ishmael</I> means <I>God hears.</I></A></LI>
