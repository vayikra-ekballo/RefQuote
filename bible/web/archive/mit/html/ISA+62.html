</DL><B>Isaiah 62</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her righteousness shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.<DT>2 <DD>The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.<DT>3 <DD>You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD's hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God.<DT>4 <DD>No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_1">1</a>]</sup>   and your land Beulah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be married.<DT>5 <DD>As a young man marries a maiden, so will your sons <sup>[<a href="#footnote_352055024_3">3</a>]</sup>   marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you. <DT>6 <DD>I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest,<DT>7 <DD>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth. <DT>8 <DD>The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: &quot;Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled;<DT>9 <DD>but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.&quot; <DT>10 <DD>Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations. <DT>11 <DD>The LORD has made proclamation to the ends of the earth: &quot;Say to the Daughter of Zion, `See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_352055024_1">[4] <I>Hephzibah</I> means <I>my delight is in her.</I></A></LI>
