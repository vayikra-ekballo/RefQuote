</DL><B>Jeremiah 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares. If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth, I will forgive this city.<DT>2 <DD>Although they say, `As surely as the LORD lives,' still they are swearing falsely.&quot; <DT>3 <DD>O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.<DT>4 <DD>I thought, &quot;These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God.<DT>5 <DD>So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God.&quot; But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds.<DT>6 <DD>Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out, for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes.<DT>8 <DD>They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man's wife.<DT>9 <DD>Should I not punish them for this?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this? <DT>10 <DD>&quot;Go through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches, for these people do not belong to the LORD.<DT>11 <DD>The house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me,&quot;   declares the LORD. <DT>12 <DD>They have lied about the LORD; they said, &quot;He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine.<DT>13 <DD>The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty says: &quot;Because the people have spoken these words, I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes.<DT>15 <DD>O house of Israel,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;I am bringing a distant nation against you-- an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand.<DT>16 <DD>Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors.<DT>17 <DD>They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust.<DT>18 <DD>&quot;Yet even in those days,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;I will not destroy you completely.<DT>19 <DD>And when the people ask, `Why has the LORD our God done all this to us?' you will tell them, `As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.'<DT>20 <DD>&quot;Announce this to the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:<DT>21 <DD>Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:<DT>22 <DD>Should you not fear me?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it.<DT>23 <DD>But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away.<DT>24 <DD>They do not say to themselves, `Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.'<DT>25 <DD>Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good. <DT>26 <DD>&quot;Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men.<DT>27 <DD>Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful<DT>28 <DD>and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it, they do not defend the rights of the poor.<DT>29 <DD>Should I not punish them for this?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this? <DT>30 <DD>&quot;A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land:<DT>31 <DD>The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end? </DL><OL></OL>
