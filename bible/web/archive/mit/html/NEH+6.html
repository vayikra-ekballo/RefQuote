</DL><B>Nehemiah 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it--though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates--<DT>2 <DD>Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: &quot;Come, let us meet together in one of the villages <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_1">1</a>]</sup>   on the plain of Ono.&quot; But they were scheming to harm me;<DT>3 <DD>so I sent messengers to them with this reply: &quot;I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?&quot;<DT>4 <DD>Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.<DT>5 <DD>Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter<DT>6 <DD>in which was written:  &quot;It is reported among the nations--and Geshem <sup>[<a href="#footnote_809591897_2">2</a>]</sup>   says it is true--that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king<DT>7 <DD>and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: `There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together.&quot; <DT>8 <DD>I sent him this reply: &quot;Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.&quot;<DT>9 <DD>They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, &quot;Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.&quot; [But I prayed,] &quot;Now strengthen my hands.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, &quot;Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you--by night they are coming to kill you.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>But I said, &quot;Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!&quot;<DT>12 <DD>I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.<DT>13 <DD>He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. <DT>14 <DD>Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.<DT>15 <DD>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.<DT>16 <DD>When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.<DT>17 <DD>Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.<DT>18 <DD>For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.<DT>19 <DD>Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_809591897_1">[2] Or <I>in Kephirim</I></A></LI>
