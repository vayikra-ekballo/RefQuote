</DL><B>Hosea 13</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When Ephraim spoke, men trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.<DT>2 <DD>Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people, &quot;They offer human sacrifice and kiss <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_1">1</a>]</sup>   the calf-idols.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;But I am the LORD your God, [who brought you] out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_2">2</a>]</sup>   Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me.<DT>5 <DD>I cared for you in the desert, in the land of burning heat.<DT>6 <DD>When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me.<DT>7 <DD>So I will come upon them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk by the path.<DT>8 <DD>Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them; a wild animal will tear them apart. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;You are destroyed, O Israel, because you are against me, against your helper.<DT>10 <DD>Where is your king, that he may save you? Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said, `Give me a king and princes'?<DT>11 <DD>So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away.<DT>12 <DD>The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record.<DT>13 <DD>Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he does not come to the opening of the womb. <DT>14 <DD>&quot;I will ransom them from the power of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_3">3</a>]</sup>  ; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_629643397_4">4</a>]</sup>   is your destruction?  &quot;I will have no compassion,<DT>15 <DD>even though he thrives among his brothers. An east wind from the LORD will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures.<DT>16 <DD>The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_629643397_1">[2] Or <I>"Men who sacrifice  kiss</I></A></LI>
