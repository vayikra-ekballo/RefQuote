</DL><B>Numbers 24</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert.<DT>2 <DD>When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him<DT>3 <DD>and he uttered his oracle: &quot;The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,<DT>4 <DD>the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_1">1</a>]</sup>   who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <DT>5 <DD>&quot;How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel! <DT>6 <DD>&quot;Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.<DT>7 <DD>Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water.  &quot;Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.<DT>9 <DD>Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse them?  &quot;May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!&quot;<DT>10 <DD>Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, &quot;I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.<DT>11 <DD>Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Balaam answered Balak, &quot;Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,<DT>13 <DD>`Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD--and I must say only what the LORD says'?<DT>14 <DD>Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>Then he uttered his oracle: &quot;The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,<DT>16 <DD>the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <DT>17 <DD>&quot;I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_2">2</a>]</sup>   of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_3">3</a>]</sup>   all the sons of Sheth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.<DT>19 <DD>A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: &quot;Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: &quot;Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;<DT>22 <DD>yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Then he uttered his oracle: &quot;Ah, who can live when God does this? <sup>[<a href="#footnote_765846446_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>24 <DD>Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_765846446_1">[4] Hebrew <I>Shaddai</I>; also in verse 16</A></LI>
