</DL><B>John 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,<DT>2 <DD>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.<DT>3 <DD>When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.<DT>4 <DD>Now he had to go through Samaria.<DT>5 <DD>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.<DT>6 <DD>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<DT>7 <DD>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, &quot;Will you give me a drink?&quot;<DT>8 <DD>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)<DT>9 <DD>The Samaritan woman said to him, &quot;You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?&quot; (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_1">1</a>]</sup> )<DT>10 <DD>Jesus answered her, &quot;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Sir,&quot; the woman said, &quot;you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?<DT>12 <DD>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,<DT>14 <DD>but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>The woman said to him, &quot;Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>He told her, &quot;Go, call your husband and come back.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>&quot;I have no husband,&quot; she replied. Jesus said to her, &quot;You are right when you say you have no husband.<DT>18 <DD>The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>&quot;Sir,&quot; the woman said, &quot;I can see that you are a prophet.<DT>20 <DD>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.&quot;<DT>21 <DD>Jesus declared, &quot;Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.<DT>22 <DD>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.<DT>23 <DD>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.<DT>24 <DD>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>The woman said, &quot;I know that Messiah&quot; (called Christ) &quot;is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.&quot;<DT>26 <DD>Then Jesus declared, &quot;I who speak to you am he.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot; or &quot;Why are you talking with her?&quot;<DT>28 <DD>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,<DT>29 <DD>&quot;Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ<sup>[<a href="#footnote_152113421_2">2</a>]</sup> ?&quot;<DT>30 <DD>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.<DT>31 <DD>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, &quot;Rabbi, eat something.&quot;<DT>32 <DD>But he said to them, &quot;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&quot;<DT>33 <DD>Then his disciples said to each other, &quot;Could someone have brought him food?&quot;<DT>34 <DD>&quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.<DT>35 <DD>Do you not say, `Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.<DT>36 <DD>Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.<DT>37 <DD>Thus the saying `One sows and another reaps' is true.<DT>38 <DD>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.&quot;<DT>39 <DD>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, &quot;He told me everything I ever did.&quot;<DT>40 <DD>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.<DT>41 <DD>And because of his words many more became believers.<DT>42 <DD>They said to the woman, &quot;We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.&quot;<DT>43 <DD>After the two days he left for Galilee.<DT>44 <DD>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)<DT>45 <DD>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.<DT>46 <DD>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.<DT>47 <DD>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.<DT>48 <DD>&quot;Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,&quot; Jesus told him, &quot;you will never believe.&quot;<DT>49 <DD>The royal official said, &quot;Sir, come down before my child dies.&quot;<DT>50 <DD>Jesus replied, &quot;You may go. Your son will live.&quot; The man took Jesus at his word and departed.<DT>51 <DD>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.<DT>52 <DD>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, &quot;The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.&quot;<DT>53 <DD>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, &quot;Your son will live.&quot; So he and all his household believed.<DT>54 <DD>This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_152113421_1">[9] Or <I>do not use dishes Samaritans have used</I></A></LI>
