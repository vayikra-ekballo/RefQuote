</DL><B>Job 33</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.<DT>2 <DD>I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.<DT>3 <DD>My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.<DT>4 <DD>The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.<DT>5 <DD>Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.<DT>6 <DD>I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.<DT>7 <DD>No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;But you have said in my hearing-- I heard the very words--<DT>9 <DD>`I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.<DT>10 <DD>Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.<DT>11 <DD>He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.' <DT>12 <DD>&quot;But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.<DT>13 <DD>Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_1">1</a>]</sup>  ?<DT>14 <DD>For God does speak--now one way, now another-- though man may not perceive it.<DT>15 <DD>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,<DT>16 <DD>he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,<DT>17 <DD>to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,<DT>18 <DD>to preserve his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_2">2</a>]</sup>   his life from perishing by the sword. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>19 <DD>Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,<DT>20 <DD>so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.<DT>21 <DD>His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.<DT>22 <DD>His soul draws near to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_4">4</a>]</sup>   and his life to the messengers of death. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_5">5</a>]</sup>   <DT>23 <DD>&quot;Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,<DT>24 <DD>to be gracious to him and say, `Spare him from going down to the pit <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_6">6</a>]</sup>  ; I have found a ransom for him'--<DT>25 <DD>then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.<DT>26 <DD>He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.<DT>27 <DD>Then he comes to men and says, `I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.<DT>28 <DD>He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_7">7</a>]</sup>   and I will live to enjoy the light.' <DT>29 <DD>&quot;God does all these things to a man-- twice, even three times--<DT>30 <DD>to turn back his soul from the pit, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_119860978_8">8</a>]</sup>   that the light of life may shine on him. <DT>31 <DD>&quot;Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.<DT>32 <DD>If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.<DT>33 <DD>But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_119860978_1">[13] Or <I>that he does not answer for any of his actions</I></A></LI>
