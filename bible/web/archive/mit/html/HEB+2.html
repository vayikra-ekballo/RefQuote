</DL><B>Hebrews 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.<DT>2 <DD>For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,<DT>3 <DD>how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.<DT>4 <DD>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.<DT>5 <DD>It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.<DT>6 <DD>But there is a place where someone has testified: &quot;What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?<DT>7 <DD>You made him a little <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_1">1</a>]</sup>   lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor<DT>8 <DD>and put everything under his feet.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_2">2</a>]</sup>   In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.<DT>9 <DD>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.<DT>10 <DD>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.<DT>11 <DD>Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.<DT>12 <DD>He says, &quot;I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>13 <DD>And again, &quot;I will put my trust in him.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_4">4</a>]</sup>   And again he says, &quot;Here am I, and the children God has given me.&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>14 <DD>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--<DT>15 <DD>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.<DT>16 <DD>For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.<DT>17 <DD>For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305435809_6">6</a>]</sup>   the sins of the people.<DT>18 <DD>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305435809_1">[7] Or <I>him for a little while</I>; also in verse 9</A></LI>
