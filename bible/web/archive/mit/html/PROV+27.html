</DL><B>Proverbs 27</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth. <DT>2 <DD>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips. <DT>3 <DD>Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both. <DT>4 <DD>Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? <DT>5 <DD>Better is open rebuke than hidden love. <DT>6 <DD>Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses. <DT>7 <DD>He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet. <DT>8 <DD>Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home. <DT>9 <DD>Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel. <DT>10 <DD>Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father, and do not go to your brother's house when disaster strikes you-- better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away. <DT>11 <DD>Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt. <DT>12 <DD>The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it. <DT>13 <DD>Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman. <DT>14 <DD>If a man loudly blesses his neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse. <DT>15 <DD>A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day;<DT>16 <DD>restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand. <DT>17 <DD>As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. <DT>18 <DD>He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored. <DT>19 <DD>As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man. <DT>20 <DD>Death and Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_118115143_1">1</a>]</sup>   are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man. <DT>21 <DD>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but man is tested by the praise he receives. <DT>22 <DD>Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding him like grain with a pestle, you will not remove his folly from him. <DT>23 <DD>Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds;<DT>24 <DD>for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.<DT>25 <DD>When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,<DT>26 <DD>the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.<DT>27 <DD>You will have plenty of goats' milk to feed you and your family and to nourish your servant girls. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_118115143_1">[20] Hebrew <I>Sheol and Abaddon</I></A></LI>
