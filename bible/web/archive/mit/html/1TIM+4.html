</DL><B>1 Timothy 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.<DT>2 <DD>Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.<DT>3 <DD>They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.<DT>4 <DD>For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,<DT>5 <DD>because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.<DT>6 <DD>If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.<DT>7 <DD>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.<DT>8 <DD>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.<DT>9 <DD>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance<DT>10 <DD>(and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe.<DT>11 <DD>Command and teach these things.<DT>12 <DD>Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.<DT>13 <DD>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.<DT>14 <DD>Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.<DT>15 <DD>Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.<DT>16 <DD>Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</DL><OL></OL>
