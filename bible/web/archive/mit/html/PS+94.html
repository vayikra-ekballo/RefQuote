</DL><B>Psalm 94</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 94 <DT>1 <DD>O LORD, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth.<DT>2 <DD>Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.<DT>3 <DD>How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked be jubilant? <DT>4 <DD>They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.<DT>5 <DD>They crush your people, O LORD; they oppress your inheritance.<DT>6 <DD>They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.<DT>7 <DD>They say, &quot;The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.&quot; <DT>8 <DD>Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?<DT>9 <DD>Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?<DT>10 <DD>Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge?<DT>11 <DD>The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile. <DT>12 <DD>Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law;<DT>13 <DD>you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.<DT>14 <DD>For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.<DT>15 <DD>Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. <DT>16 <DD>Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?<DT>17 <DD>Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.<DT>18 <DD>When I said, &quot;My foot is slipping,&quot; your love, O LORD, supported me.<DT>19 <DD>When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul. <DT>20 <DD>Can a corrupt throne be allied with you-- one that brings on misery by its decrees?<DT>21 <DD>They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.<DT>22 <DD>But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.<DT>23 <DD>He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them. </DL><OL></OL>
