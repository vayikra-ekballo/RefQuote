</DL><B>Job 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.<DT>2 <DD>Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.<DT>3 <DD>Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.<DT>4 <DD>Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.<DT>5 <DD>The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;<DT>6 <DD>sapphires <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_1">1</a>]</sup>   come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.<DT>7 <DD>No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.<DT>8 <DD>Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.<DT>9 <DD>Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.<DT>10 <DD>He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.<DT>11 <DD>He searches <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_2">2</a>]</sup>   the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?<DT>13 <DD>Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.<DT>14 <DD>The deep says, `It is not in me'; the sea says, `It is not with me.'<DT>15 <DD>It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.<DT>16 <DD>It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.<DT>17 <DD>Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.<DT>18 <DD>Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.<DT>19 <DD>The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold. <DT>20 <DD>&quot;Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?<DT>21 <DD>It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.<DT>22 <DD>Destruction <sup>[<a href="#footnote_565097987_3">3</a>]</sup>   and Death say, `Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'<DT>23 <DD>God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,<DT>24 <DD>for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.<DT>25 <DD>When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,<DT>26 <DD>when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,<DT>27 <DD>then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.<DT>28 <DD>And he said to man, `The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_565097987_1">[6] Or <I>lapis lazuli</I>; also in verse 16</A></LI>
