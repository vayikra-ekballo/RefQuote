</DL><B>Isaiah 25</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things, things planned long ago.<DT>2 <DD>You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.<DT>3 <DD>Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you.<DT>4 <DD>You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall<DT>5 <DD>and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled. <DT>6 <DD>On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine-- the best of meats and the finest of wines.<DT>7 <DD>On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;<DT>8 <DD>he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth.  The LORD has spoken.<DT>9 <DD>In that day they will say, &quot;Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.&quot; <DT>10 <DD>The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.<DT>11 <DD>They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_874045182_1">1</a>]</sup>   of their hands.<DT>12 <DD>He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_874045182_1">[11] The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.</A></LI>
