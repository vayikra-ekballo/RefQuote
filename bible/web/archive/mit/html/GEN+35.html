</DL><B>Genesis 35</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then God said to Jacob, &quot;Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &quot;Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.<DT>3 <DD>Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.<DT>5 <DD>Then they set out, and the terror of God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.<DT>6 <DD>Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.<DT>7 <DD>There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_1">1</a>]</sup>   because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.<DT>8 <DD>Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_3">3</a>]</sup>   God appeared to him again and blessed him.<DT>10 <DD>God said to him, &quot;Your name is Jacob, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_4">4</a>]</sup>   but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_5">5</a>]</sup>  &quot; So he named him Israel.<DT>11 <DD>And God said to him, &quot;I am God Almighty <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_6">6</a>]</sup>  ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body.<DT>12 <DD>The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.<DT>14 <DD>Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.<DT>15 <DD>Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_7">7</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.<DT>17 <DD>And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, &quot;Don't be afraid, for you have another son.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>As she breathed her last--for she was dying--she named her son Ben-Oni. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_8">8</a>]</sup>   But his father named him Benjamin. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_882130860_9">9</a>]</sup>  <DT>19 <DD>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).<DT>20 <DD>Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb.<DT>21 <DD>Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.<DT>22 <DD>While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.  Jacob had twelve sons:<DT>23 <DD>The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.<DT>24 <DD>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.<DT>25 <DD>The sons of Rachel's maidservant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.<DT>26 <DD>The sons of Leah's maidservant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. <DT>27 <DD>Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.<DT>28 <DD>Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.<DT>29 <DD>Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_882130860_1">[7] <I>El Bethel</I> means <I>God of Bethel.</I></A></LI>
