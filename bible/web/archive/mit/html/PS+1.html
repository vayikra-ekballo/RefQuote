</DL><B>Psalm 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.<DT>2 <DD>But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.<DT>3 <DD>He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. <DT>4 <DD>Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.<DT>5 <DD>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. <DT>6 <DD>For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish. </DL><OL></OL>
