</DL><B>Psalm 19</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 19  For the director of music. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<DT>2 <DD>Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.<DT>3 <DD>There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_397670913_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>Their voice <sup>[<a href="#footnote_397670913_2">2</a>]</sup>   goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.  In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun,<DT>5 <DD>which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.<DT>6 <DD>It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat. <DT>7 <DD>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.<DT>8 <DD>The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.<DT>9 <DD>The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.<DT>10 <DD>They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.<DT>11 <DD>By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. <DT>12 <DD>Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults.<DT>13 <DD>Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. <DT>14 <DD>May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_397670913_1">[3] Or <I>They have no speech, there are no words;  no sound is heard from them</I></A></LI>
