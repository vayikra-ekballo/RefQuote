</DL><B>Hosea 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones.<DT>2 <DD>Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones. <DT>3 <DD>Then they will say, &quot;We have no king because we did not revere the LORD. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?&quot;<DT>4 <DD>They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.<DT>5 <DD>The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_1">1</a>]</sup>   Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile.<DT>6 <DD>It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>7 <DD>Samaria and its king will float away like a twig on the surface of the waters.<DT>8 <DD>The high places of wickedness <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_3">3</a>]</sup>   will be destroyed-- it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, &quot;Cover us!&quot; and to the hills, &quot;Fall on us!&quot; <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_154358411_4">4</a>]</sup>   Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?<DT>10 <DD>When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin.<DT>11 <DD>Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground.<DT>12 <DD>Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers righteousness on you.<DT>13 <DD>But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors,<DT>14 <DD>the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated-- as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children.<DT>15 <DD>Thus will it happen to you, O Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_154358411_1">[5] <I>Beth Aven</I> means <I>house of wickedness</I> (a name for Bethel, which means <I>house of God</I>).</A></LI>
