</DL><B>Psalm 5</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 5  For the director of music. For flutes. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.<DT>2 <DD>Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.<DT>3 <DD>In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation. <DT>4 <DD>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; with you the wicked cannot dwell.<DT>5 <DD>The arrogant cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who do wrong.<DT>6 <DD>You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the LORD abhors. <DT>7 <DD>But I, by your great mercy, will come into your house; in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.<DT>8 <DD>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies-- make straight your way before me. <DT>9 <DD>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit.<DT>10 <DD>Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. <DT>11 <DD>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.<DT>12 <DD>For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield. </DL><OL></OL>
