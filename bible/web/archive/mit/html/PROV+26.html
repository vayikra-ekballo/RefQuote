</DL><B>Proverbs 26</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool. <DT>2 <DD>Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest. <DT>3 <DD>A whip for the horse, a halter for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools! <DT>4 <DD>Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself. <DT>5 <DD>Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes. <DT>6 <DD>Like cutting off one's feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool. <DT>7 <DD>Like a lame man's legs that hang limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. <DT>8 <DD>Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool. <DT>9 <DD>Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. <DT>10 <DD>Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or any passer-by. <DT>11 <DD>As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. <DT>12 <DD>Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. <DT>13 <DD>The sluggard says, &quot;There is a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!&quot; <DT>14 <DD>As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed. <DT>15 <DD>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. <DT>16 <DD>The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly. <DT>17 <DD>Like one who seizes a dog by the ears is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own. <DT>18 <DD>Like a madman shooting firebrands or deadly arrows<DT>19 <DD>is a man who deceives his neighbor and says, &quot;I was only joking!&quot; <DT>20 <DD>Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down. <DT>21 <DD>As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. <DT>22 <DD>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts. <DT>23 <DD>Like a coating of glaze <sup>[<a href="#footnote_148687999_1">1</a>]</sup>   over earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart. <DT>24 <DD>A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but in his heart he harbors deceit.<DT>25 <DD>Though his speech is charming, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.<DT>26 <DD>His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. <DT>27 <DD>If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him. <DT>28 <DD>A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_148687999_1">[23] With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text <I>of silver dross</I></A></LI>
