</DL><B>John 21</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_1">1</a>]</sup>   It happened this way:<DT>2 <DD>Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.<DT>3 <DD>&quot;I'm going out to fish,&quot; Simon Peter told them, and they said, &quot;We'll go with you.&quot; So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.<DT>4 <DD>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.<DT>5 <DD>He called out to them, &quot;Friends, haven't you any fish?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; they answered.<DT>6 <DD>He said, &quot;Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.&quot; When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.<DT>7 <DD>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &quot;It is the Lord!&quot; As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, &quot;It is the Lord,&quot; he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.<DT>8 <DD>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_171921359_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>9 <DD>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.<DT>10 <DD>Jesus said to them, &quot;Bring some of the fish you have just caught.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.<DT>12 <DD>Jesus said to them, &quot;Come and have breakfast.&quot; None of the disciples dared ask him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; They knew it was the Lord.<DT>13 <DD>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.<DT>14 <DD>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.<DT>15 <DD>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &quot;Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; he said, &quot;you know that I love you.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Feed my lambs.&quot;<DT>16 <DD>Again Jesus said, &quot;Simon son of John, do you truly love me?&quot; He answered, &quot;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Take care of my sheep.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>The third time he said to him, &quot;Simon son of John, do you love me?&quot; Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &quot;Do you love me?&quot; He said, &quot;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Feed my sheep.<DT>18 <DD>I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&quot;<DT>19 <DD>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, &quot;Follow me!&quot;<DT>20 <DD>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, &quot;Lord, who is going to betray you?&quot;)<DT>21 <DD>When Peter saw him, he asked, &quot;Lord, what about him?&quot;<DT>22 <DD>Jesus answered, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?&quot;<DT>24 <DD>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.<DT>25 <DD>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_171921359_1">[1] That is, Sea of Galilee</A></LI>
