</DL><B>Isaiah 20</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it--<DT>2 <DD>at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, &quot;Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.&quot; And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.<DT>3 <DD>Then the LORD said, &quot;Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_238916283_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared--to Egypt's shame.<DT>5 <DD>Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame.<DT>6 <DD>In that day the people who live on this coast will say, `See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?'&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_238916283_1">[3] That is, the upper Nile region; also in verse 5</A></LI>
