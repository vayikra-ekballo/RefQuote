</DL><B>Ezekiel 22</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices<DT>3 <DD>and say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,<DT>4 <DD>you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.<DT>5 <DD>Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;`See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.<DT>7 <DD>In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.<DT>8 <DD>You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.<DT>9 <DD>In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.<DT>10 <DD>In you are those who dishonor their fathers' bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.<DT>11 <DD>In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor's wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father's daughter.<DT>12 <DD>In you men accept bribes to shed blood; you take usury and excessive interest <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_1">1</a>]</sup>   and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;`I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.<DT>14 <DD>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.<DT>15 <DD>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.<DT>16 <DD>When you have been defiled <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_2">2</a>]</sup>   in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.'&quot;<DT>17 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to me:<DT>18 <DD>&quot;Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.<DT>19 <DD>Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: `Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem.<DT>20 <DD>As men gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.<DT>21 <DD>I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her.<DT>22 <DD>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you.'&quot;<DT>23 <DD>Again the word of the LORD came to me:<DT>24 <DD>&quot;Son of man, say to the land, `You are a land that has had no rain or showers <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_3">3</a>]</sup>   in the day of wrath.'<DT>25 <DD>There is a conspiracy of her princes <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141380071_4">4</a>]</sup>   within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.<DT>26 <DD>Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.<DT>27 <DD>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.<DT>28 <DD>Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, `This is what the Sovereign LORD says'--when the LORD has not spoken.<DT>29 <DD>The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien, denying them justice.<DT>30 <DD>&quot;I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found none.<DT>31 <DD>So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_141380071_1">[12] Or <I>usury and interest</I></A></LI>
