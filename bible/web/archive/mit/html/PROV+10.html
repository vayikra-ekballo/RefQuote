</DL><B>Proverbs 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to his father, but a foolish son grief to his mother. <DT>2 <DD>Ill-gotten treasures are of no value, but righteousness delivers from death. <DT>3 <DD>The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry but he thwarts the craving of the wicked. <DT>4 <DD>Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth. <DT>5 <DD>He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son. <DT>6 <DD>Blessings crown the head of the righteous, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_206236450_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>7 <DD>The memory of the righteous will be a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot. <DT>8 <DD>The wise in heart accept commands, but a chattering fool comes to ruin. <DT>9 <DD>The man of integrity walks securely, but he who takes crooked paths will be found out. <DT>10 <DD>He who winks maliciously causes grief, and a chattering fool comes to ruin. <DT>11 <DD>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked. <DT>12 <DD>Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs. <DT>13 <DD>Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks judgment. <DT>14 <DD>Wise men store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin. <DT>15 <DD>The wealth of the rich is their fortified city, but poverty is the ruin of the poor. <DT>16 <DD>The wages of the righteous bring them life, but the income of the wicked brings them punishment. <DT>17 <DD>He who heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray. <DT>18 <DD>He who conceals his hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is a fool. <DT>19 <DD>When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise. <DT>20 <DD>The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked is of little value. <DT>21 <DD>The lips of the righteous nourish many, but fools die for lack of judgment. <DT>22 <DD>The blessing of the LORD brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it. <DT>23 <DD>A fool finds pleasure in evil conduct, but a man of understanding delights in wisdom. <DT>24 <DD>What the wicked dreads will overtake him; what the righteous desire will be granted. <DT>25 <DD>When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever. <DT>26 <DD>As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is a sluggard to those who send him. <DT>27 <DD>The fear of the LORD adds length to life, but the years of the wicked are cut short. <DT>28 <DD>The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing. <DT>29 <DD>The way of the LORD is a refuge for the righteous, but it is the ruin of those who do evil. <DT>30 <DD>The righteous will never be uprooted, but the wicked will not remain in the land. <DT>31 <DD>The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but a perverse tongue will be cut out. <DT>32 <DD>The lips of the righteous know what is fitting, but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_206236450_1">[6] Or <I>but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence</I>; also in verse 11</A></LI>
