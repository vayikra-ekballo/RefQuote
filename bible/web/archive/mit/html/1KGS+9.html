</DL><B>1 Kings 9</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do,<DT>2 <DD>the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.<DT>3 <DD>The LORD said to him:  &quot;I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.<DT>4 <DD>&quot;As for you, if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws,<DT>5 <DD>I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, `You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'<DT>6 <DD>&quot;But if you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_1">1</a>]</sup>   or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_2">2</a>]</sup>   and go off to serve other gods and worship them,<DT>7 <DD>then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.<DT>8 <DD>And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, `Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'<DT>9 <DD>People will answer, `Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them--that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'&quot; <DT>10 <DD>At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings--the temple of the LORD and the royal palace--<DT>11 <DD>King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted.<DT>12 <DD>But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.<DT>13 <DD>&quot;What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?&quot; he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_3">3</a>]</sup>   a name they have to this day.<DT>14 <DD>Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_4">4</a>]</sup>   of gold.<DT>15 <DD>Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_5">5</a>]</sup>   the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.<DT>16 <DD>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.<DT>17 <DD>And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon,<DT>18 <DD>Baalath, and Tadmor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_6">6</a>]</sup>   in the desert, within his land,<DT>19 <DD>as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_7">7</a>]</sup>  --whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.<DT>20 <DD>All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),<DT>21 <DD>that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_8">8</a>]</sup>  --these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.<DT>22 <DD>But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.<DT>23 <DD>They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects--550 officials supervising the men who did the work.<DT>24 <DD>After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the supporting terraces.<DT>25 <DD>Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_9">9</a>]</sup>   on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.<DT>26 <DD>King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_10">10</a>]</sup>  <DT>27 <DD>And Hiram sent his men--sailors who knew the sea--to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.<DT>28 <DD>They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115556033_11">11</a>]</sup>   of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115556033_1">[6] The Hebrew is plural.</A></LI>
