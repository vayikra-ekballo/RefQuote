</DL><B>Philemon 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,  To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,<DT>2 <DD>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: <DT>3 <DD>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <DT>4 <DD>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,<DT>5 <DD>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.<DT>6 <DD>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.<DT>7 <DD>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.<DT>8 <DD>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,<DT>9 <DD>yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--<DT>10 <DD>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_680420847_1">1</a>]</sup>   who became my son while I was in chains.<DT>11 <DD>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.<DT>12 <DD>I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.<DT>13 <DD>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.<DT>14 <DD>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.<DT>15 <DD>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--<DT>16 <DD>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.<DT>17 <DD>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.<DT>18 <DD>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.<DT>19 <DD>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.<DT>20 <DD>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.<DT>21 <DD>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.<DT>22 <DD>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. <DT>23 <DD>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.<DT>24 <DD>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.<DT>25 <DD>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_680420847_1">[10] <I>Onesimus</I> means <I>useful.</I></A></LI>
