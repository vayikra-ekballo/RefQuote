</DL><B>Psalm 62</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 62  For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.<DT>1 <DD>My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.<DT>2 <DD>He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken. <DT>3 <DD>How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down-- this leaning wall, this tottering fence?<DT>4 <DD>They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Selah <DT>5 <DD>Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from him.<DT>6 <DD>He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.<DT>7 <DD>My salvation and my honor depend on God <sup>[<a href="#footnote_127918997_1">1</a>]</sup>  ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.<DT>8 <DD>Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge. Selah <DT>9 <DD>Lowborn men are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.<DT>10 <DD>Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them. <DT>11 <DD>One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard: that you, O God, are strong,<DT>12 <DD>and that you, O Lord, are loving. Surely you will reward each person according to what he has done. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_127918997_1">[7] Or  <I>God Most High is my salvation and my honor</I></A></LI>
