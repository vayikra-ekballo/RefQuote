</DL><B>Colossians 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.<DT>2 <DD>Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.<DT>3 <DD>And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.<DT>4 <DD>Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.<DT>5 <DD>Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.<DT>6 <DD>Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.<DT>7 <DD>Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.<DT>8 <DD>I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our <sup>[<a href="#footnote_158199311_1">1</a>]</sup>   circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.<DT>9 <DD>He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.<DT>10 <DD>My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)<DT>11 <DD>Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.<DT>12 <DD>Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.<DT>13 <DD>I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.<DT>14 <DD>Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.<DT>15 <DD>Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.<DT>16 <DD>After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.<DT>17 <DD>Tell Archippus: &quot;See to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_158199311_1">[8] Some manuscripts <I>that he may know about your</I></A></LI>
