</DL><B>Psalm 109</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 109  For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>O God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,<DT>2 <DD>for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.<DT>3 <DD>With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.<DT>4 <DD>In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.<DT>5 <DD>They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship. <DT>6 <DD>Appoint <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_1">1</a>]</sup>   an evil man <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_2">2</a>]</sup>   to oppose him; let an accuser <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_3">3</a>]</sup>   stand at his right hand.<DT>7 <DD>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.<DT>8 <DD>May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.<DT>9 <DD>May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.<DT>10 <DD>May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_4">4</a>]</sup>   from their ruined homes.<DT>11 <DD>May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.<DT>12 <DD>May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.<DT>13 <DD>May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.<DT>14 <DD>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.<DT>15 <DD>May their sins always remain before the LORD, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. <DT>16 <DD>For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.<DT>17 <DD>He loved to pronounce a curse-- may it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_5">5</a>]</sup>   come on him; he found no pleasure in blessing-- may it be <sup>[<a href="#footnote_200629110_6">6</a>]</sup>   far from him.<DT>18 <DD>He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.<DT>19 <DD>May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.<DT>20 <DD>May this be the LORD's payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me. <DT>21 <DD>But you, O Sovereign LORD, deal well with me for your name's sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.<DT>22 <DD>For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<DT>23 <DD>I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.<DT>24 <DD>My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.<DT>25 <DD>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads. <DT>26 <DD>Help me, O LORD my God; save me in accordance with your love.<DT>27 <DD>Let them know that it is your hand, that you, O LORD, have done it.<DT>28 <DD>They may curse, but you will bless; when they attack they will be put to shame, but your servant will rejoice.<DT>29 <DD>My accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. <DT>30 <DD>With my mouth I will greatly extol the LORD; in the great throng I will praise him.<DT>31 <DD>For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save his life from those who condemn him. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_200629110_1">[6] Or <I>[They say:] "Appoint</I> (with quotation marks at the end of verse 19)</A></LI>
