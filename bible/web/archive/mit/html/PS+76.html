A song.<DT>1 <DD>In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.<DT>2 <DD>His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.<DT>3 <DD>There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.  Selah <DT>4 <DD>You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.<DT>5 <DD>Valiant men lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.<DT>6 <DD>At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.<DT>7 <DD>You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?<DT>8 <DD>From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet--<DT>9 <DD>when you, O God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah<DT>10 <DD>Surely your wrath against men brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_238916283_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>11 <DD>Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.<DT>12 <DD>He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_238916283_1">[10] Or <I>Surely the wrath of men brings you praise,  and with the remainder of wrath you arm yourself</I></A></LI>
