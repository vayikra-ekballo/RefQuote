</DL><B>Jeremiah 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Hear what the LORD says to you, O house of Israel.<DT>2 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky, though the nations are terrified by them.<DT>3 <DD>For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.<DT>4 <DD>They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.<DT>5 <DD>Like a scarecrow in a melon patch, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.&quot; <DT>6 <DD>No one is like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.<DT>7 <DD>Who should not revere you, O King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.<DT>8 <DD>They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols.<DT>9 <DD>Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple-- all made by skilled workers.<DT>10 <DD>But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Tell them this: `These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.'&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_207182871_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>12 <DD>But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.<DT>13 <DD>When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <DT>14 <DD>Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them.<DT>15 <DD>They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish.<DT>16 <DD>He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the tribe of his inheritance-- the LORD Almighty is his name. <DT>17 <DD>Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege.<DT>18 <DD>For this is what the LORD says: &quot;At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.&quot; <DT>19 <DD>Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, &quot;This is my sickness, and I must endure it.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My sons are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.<DT>21 <DD>The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered.<DT>22 <DD>Listen! The report is coming-- a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. <DT>23 <DD>I know, O LORD, that a man's life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps.<DT>24 <DD>Correct me, LORD, but only with justice-- not in your anger, lest you reduce me to nothing.<DT>25 <DD>Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_207182871_1">[11] The text of this verse is in Aramaic.</A></LI>
