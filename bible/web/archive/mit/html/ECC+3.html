</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven: <DT>2 <DD>a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,<DT>3 <DD>a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,<DT>4 <DD>a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,<DT>5 <DD>a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,<DT>6 <DD>a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,<DT>7 <DD>a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,<DT>8 <DD>a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.<DT>9 <DD>What does the worker gain from his toil?<DT>10 <DD>I have seen the burden God has laid on men.<DT>11 <DD>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.<DT>12 <DD>I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.<DT>13 <DD>That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil--this is the gift of God.<DT>14 <DD>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.<DT>15 <DD>Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>16 <DD>And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment--wickedness was there, in the place of justice--wickedness was there.<DT>17 <DD>I thought in my heart, &quot;God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>I also thought, &quot;As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.<DT>19 <DD>Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_2">2</a>]</sup>  ; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.<DT>20 <DD>All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.<DT>21 <DD>Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal <sup>[<a href="#footnote_121817167_3">3</a>]</sup>   goes down into the earth?&quot;<DT>22 <DD>So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him? </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_121817167_1">[15] Or <I>God calls back the past</I></A></LI>
