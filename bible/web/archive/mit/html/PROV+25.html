</DL><B>Proverbs 25</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:<DT>2 <DD>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings. <DT>3 <DD>As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. <DT>4 <DD>Remove the dross from the silver, and out comes material for <sup>[<a href="#footnote_179795029_1">1</a>]</sup>   the silversmith;<DT>5 <DD>remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness. <DT>6 <DD>Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among great men;<DT>7 <DD>it is better for him to say to you, &quot;Come up here,&quot; than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman.  What you have seen with your eyes<DT>8 <DD>do not bring <sup>[<a href="#footnote_179795029_2">2</a>]</sup>   hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame? <DT>9 <DD>If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,<DT>10 <DD>or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation. <DT>11 <DD>A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. <DT>12 <DD>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear. <DT>13 <DD>Like the coolness of snow at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the spirit of his masters. <DT>14 <DD>Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give. <DT>15 <DD>Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone. <DT>16 <DD>If you find honey, eat just enough-- too much of it, and you will vomit.<DT>17 <DD>Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house-- too much of you, and he will hate you. <DT>18 <DD>Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor. <DT>19 <DD>Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble. <DT>20 <DD>Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. <DT>21 <DD>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.<DT>22 <DD>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you. <DT>23 <DD>As a north wind brings rain, so a sly tongue brings angry looks. <DT>24 <DD>Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. <DT>25 <DD>Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land. <DT>26 <DD>Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked. <DT>27 <DD>It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor. <DT>28 <DD>Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_179795029_1">[4] Or <I>comes a vessel from</I></A></LI>
