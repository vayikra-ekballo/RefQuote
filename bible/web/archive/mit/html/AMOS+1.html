</DL><B>Amos 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa--what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_1">1</a>]</sup>   was king of Israel.<DT>2 <DD>He said: &quot;The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_2">2</a>]</sup>   and the top of Carmel withers.&quot;<DT>3 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth,<DT>4 <DD>I will send fire upon the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.<DT>5 <DD>I will break down the gate of Damascus; I will destroy the king who is in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_3">3</a>]</sup>   the Valley of Aven <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_4">4</a>]</sup>   and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,&quot; says the LORD.<DT>6 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom,<DT>7 <DD>I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.<DT>8 <DD>I will destroy the king <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_5">5</a>]</sup>   of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is dead,&quot; says the Sovereign LORD.<DT>9 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,<DT>10 <DD>I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because he pursued his brother with a sword, stifling all compassion, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_6">6</a>]</sup>   because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,<DT>12 <DD>I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>This is what the LORD says: &quot;For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not turn back [my wrath]. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders,<DT>14 <DD>I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day.<DT>15 <DD>Her king <sup>[<a href="#footnote_213485129_7">7</a>]</sup>   will go into exile, he and his officials together,&quot; says the LORD.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_213485129_1">[1] Hebrew <I>Joash,</I> a variant of <I>Jehoash</I></A></LI>
