</DL><B>Hosea 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Ephraim feeds on the wind; he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.<DT>2 <DD>The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_1">1</a>]</sup>   according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.<DT>3 <DD>In the womb he grasped his brother's heel; as a man he struggled with God.<DT>4 <DD>He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there--<DT>5 <DD>the LORD God Almighty, the LORD is his name of renown!<DT>6 <DD>But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always. <DT>7 <DD>The merchant uses dishonest scales; he loves to defraud.<DT>8 <DD>Ephraim boasts, &quot;I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>&quot;I am the LORD your God, [who brought you] out of <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_2">2</a>]</sup>   Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed feasts.<DT>10 <DD>I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them.&quot; <DT>11 <DD>Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.<DT>12 <DD>Jacob fled to the country of Aram <sup>[<a href="#footnote_941945324_3">3</a>]</sup>  ; Israel served to get a wife, and to pay for her he tended sheep.<DT>13 <DD>The LORD used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him.<DT>14 <DD>But Ephraim has bitterly provoked him to anger; his Lord will leave upon him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_941945324_1">[2] <I>Jacob</I> means <I>he grasps the heel</I> (figuratively, <I>he deceives</I>).</A></LI>
