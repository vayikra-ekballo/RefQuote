</DL><B>Habakkuk 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>2 <DD>Then the LORD replied: &quot;Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_2">2</a>]</sup>   may run with it.<DT>3 <DD>For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_3">3</a>]</sup>   will certainly come and will not delay. <DT>4 <DD>&quot;See, he is puffed up; his desires are not upright-- but the righteous will live by his faith <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_4">4</a>]</sup>  --<DT>5 <DD>indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_5">5</a>]</sup>   and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, &quot;`Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?'<DT>7 <DD>Will not your debtors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_6">6</a>]</sup>   suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.<DT>8 <DD>Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. <DT>9 <DD>&quot;Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high, to escape the clutches of ruin!<DT>10 <DD>You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.<DT>11 <DD>The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it. <DT>12 <DD>&quot;Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime!<DT>13 <DD>Has not the LORD Almighty determined that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?<DT>14 <DD>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. <DT>15 <DD>&quot;Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies.<DT>16 <DD>You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and be exposed <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_7">7</a>]</sup>  ! The cup from the LORD's right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.<DT>17 <DD>The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed man's blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. <DT>18 <DD>&quot;Of what value is an idol, since a man has carved it? Or an image that teaches lies? For he who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.<DT>19 <DD>Woe to him who says to wood, `Come to life!' Or to lifeless stone, `Wake up!' Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.<DT>20 <DD>But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_452265626_1">[1] Or <I>and what to answer when I am rebuked</I></A></LI>
