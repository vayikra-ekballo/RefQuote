</DL><B>Proverbs 28</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The wicked man flees though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. <DT>2 <DD>When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order. <DT>3 <DD>A ruler <sup>[<a href="#footnote_896478899_1">1</a>]</sup>   who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. <DT>4 <DD>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them. <DT>5 <DD>Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it fully. <DT>6 <DD>Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse. <DT>7 <DD>He who keeps the law is a discerning son, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father. <DT>8 <DD>He who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor. <DT>9 <DD>If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable. <DT>10 <DD>He who leads the upright along an evil path will fall into his own trap, but the blameless will receive a good inheritance. <DT>11 <DD>A rich man may be wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has discernment sees through him. <DT>12 <DD>When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; but when the wicked rise to power, men go into hiding. <DT>13 <DD>He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. <DT>14 <DD>Blessed is the man who always fears the LORD, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble. <DT>15 <DD>Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people. <DT>16 <DD>A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment, but he who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long life. <DT>17 <DD>A man tormented by the guilt of murder will be a fugitive till death; let no one support him. <DT>18 <DD>He whose walk is blameless is kept safe, but he whose ways are perverse will suddenly fall. <DT>19 <DD>He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. <DT>20 <DD>A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. <DT>21 <DD>To show partiality is not good-- yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. <DT>22 <DD>A stingy man is eager to get rich and is unaware that poverty awaits him. <DT>23 <DD>He who rebukes a man will in the end gain more favor than he who has a flattering tongue. <DT>24 <DD>He who robs his father or mother and says, &quot;It's not wrong&quot;-- he is partner to him who destroys. <DT>25 <DD>A greedy man stirs up dissension, but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper. <DT>26 <DD>He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe. <DT>27 <DD>He who gives to the poor will lack nothing, but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses. <DT>28 <DD>When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding; but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_896478899_1">[3] Or <I>A poor man</I></A></LI>
