</DL><B>Psalm 55</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 55  For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_1">1</a>]</sup>   of David.<DT>1 <DD>Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;<DT>2 <DD>hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught<DT>3 <DD>at the voice of the enemy, at the stares of the wicked; for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger. <DT>4 <DD>My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death assail me.<DT>5 <DD>Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.<DT>6 <DD>I said, &quot;Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest--<DT>7 <DD>I would flee far away and stay in the desert;  Selah<DT>8 <DD>I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.<DT>10 <DD>Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.<DT>11 <DD>Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets. <DT>12 <DD>If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were raising himself against me, I could hide from him.<DT>13 <DD>But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,<DT>14 <DD>with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of God. <DT>15 <DD>Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the grave, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_126533812_2">2</a>]</sup>   for evil finds lodging among them. <DT>16 <DD>But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.<DT>17 <DD>Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.<DT>18 <DD>He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.<DT>19 <DD>God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them-- Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God. <DT>20 <DD>My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.<DT>21 <DD>His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords. <DT>22 <DD>Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall.<DT>23 <DD>But you, O God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption; bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days.  But as for me, I trust in you. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_126533812_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
