</DL><B>Psalm 90</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 90  A prayer of Moses the man of God.<DT>1 <DD>Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.<DT>2 <DD>Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. <DT>3 <DD>You turn men back to dust, saying, &quot;Return to dust, O sons of men.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.<DT>5 <DD>You sweep men away in the sleep of death; they are like the new grass of the morning--<DT>6 <DD>though in the morning it springs up new, by evening it is dry and withered. <DT>7 <DD>We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.<DT>8 <DD>You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.<DT>9 <DD>All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.<DT>10 <DD>The length of our days is seventy years-- or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away. <DT>11 <DD>Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.<DT>12 <DD>Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. <DT>13 <DD>Relent, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.<DT>14 <DD>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.<DT>15 <DD>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.<DT>16 <DD>May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children. <DT>17 <DD>May the favor <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_2">2</a>]</sup>   of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us-- yes, establish the work of our hands. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[10] Or <I>yet the best of them</I></A></LI>
