</DL><B>Zechariah 4</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the angel who talked with me returned and wakened me, as a man is wakened from his sleep.<DT>2 <DD>He asked me, &quot;What do you see?&quot; I answered, &quot;I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it, with seven channels to the lights.<DT>3 <DD>Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>I asked the angel who talked with me, &quot;What are these, my lord?&quot;<DT>5 <DD>He answered, &quot;Do you not know what these are?&quot; &quot;No, my lord,&quot; I replied.<DT>6 <DD>So he said to me, &quot;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: `Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the LORD Almighty.<DT>7 <DD>&quot;What <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_1">1</a>]</sup>   are you, O mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of `God bless it! God bless it!'&quot;<DT>8 <DD>Then the word of the LORD came to me:<DT>9 <DD>&quot;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;Who despises the day of small things? Men will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. &quot;(These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range throughout the earth.)&quot;<DT>11 <DD>Then I asked the angel, &quot;What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?&quot;<DT>12 <DD>Again I asked him, &quot;What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>He replied, &quot;Do you not know what these are?&quot; &quot;No, my lord,&quot; I said.<DT>14 <DD>So he said, &quot;These are the two who are anointed to <sup>[<a href="#footnote_892662446_2">2</a>]</sup>   serve the Lord of all the earth.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_892662446_1">[7] Or <I>Who</I></A></LI>
