</DL><B>Hosea 14</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall!<DT>2 <DD>Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: &quot;Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141184967_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>3 <DD>Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses. We will never again say `Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.&quot; <DT>4 <DD>&quot;I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.<DT>5 <DD>I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots;<DT>6 <DD>his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.<DT>7 <DD>Men will dwell again in his shade. He will flourish like the grain. He will blossom like a vine, and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon.<DT>8 <DD>O Ephraim, what more have I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_141184967_2">2</a>]</sup>   to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a green pine tree; your fruitfulness comes from me.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.  </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_141184967_1">[2] Or <I>offer our lips as sacrifices of bulls</I></A></LI>
