And he built up the town and settled there.<DT>51 <DD>These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_188265317_1">[2] Or <I>Beersheba, Sheba</I>; 1 Chron. 4:28 does not have <I>Sheba.</I></A></LI>
