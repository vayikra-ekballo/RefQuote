</DL><B>Psalm 58</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 58  For the director of music. [To the tune of] &quot;Do Not Destroy.&quot; Of David. A miktam. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>1 <DD>Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?<DT>2 <DD>No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.<DT>3 <DD>Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.<DT>4 <DD>Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,<DT>5 <DD>that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be. <DT>6 <DD>Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O LORD, the fangs of the lions!<DT>7 <DD>Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted.<DT>8 <DD>Like a slug melting away as it moves along, like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun. <DT>9 <DD>Before your pots can feel [the heat of] the thorns-- whether they be green or dry--the wicked will be swept away. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_142197556_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>10 <DD>The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.<DT>11 <DD>Then men will say, &quot;Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_142197556_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
