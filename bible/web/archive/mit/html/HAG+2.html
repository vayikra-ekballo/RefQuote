</DL><B>Haggai 2</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them,<DT>3 <DD>`Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?<DT>4 <DD>But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD. `Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' declares the LORD, `and work. For I am with you,' declares the LORD Almighty.<DT>5 <DD>`This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.'<DT>6 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD Almighty says: `In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.<DT>7 <DD>I will shake all nations, and the desired of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD Almighty.<DT>8 <DD>`The silver is mine and the gold is mine,' declares the LORD Almighty.<DT>9 <DD>`The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,' says the LORD Almighty. `And in this place I will grant peace,' declares the LORD Almighty.&quot;<DT>10 <DD>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Haggai:<DT>11 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD Almighty says: `Ask the priests what the law says:<DT>12 <DD>If a person carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, oil or other food, does it become consecrated?'&quot; The priests answered, &quot;No.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Then Haggai said, &quot;If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; the priests replied, &quot;it becomes defiled.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>Then Haggai said, &quot;`So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,' declares the LORD. `Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.<DT>15 <DD>&quot;`Now give careful thought to this from this day on <sup>[<a href="#footnote_107536116_1">1</a>]</sup>  --consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the LORD's temple.<DT>16 <DD>When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.<DT>17 <DD>I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not turn to me,' declares the LORD.<DT>18 <DD>`From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid. Give careful thought:<DT>19 <DD>Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit. &quot;`From this day on I will bless you.'&quot;<DT>20 <DD>The word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:<DT>21 <DD>&quot;Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I will shake the heavens and the earth.<DT>22 <DD>I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.<DT>23 <DD>&quot;`On that day,' declares the LORD Almighty, `I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares the LORD, `and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,' declares the LORD Almighty.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_107536116_1">[15] Or <I>to the days past</I></A></LI>
