</DL><B>Hosea 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>&quot;When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.<DT>2 <DD>But the more I <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_1">1</a>]</sup>   called Israel, the further they went from me. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_2">2</a>]</sup>   They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.<DT>3 <DD>It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them.<DT>4 <DD>I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love; I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them. <DT>5 <DD>&quot;Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?<DT>6 <DD>Swords will flash in their cities, will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans.<DT>7 <DD>My people are determined to turn from me. Even if they call to the Most High, he will by no means exalt them. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused.<DT>9 <DD>I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I am God, and not man-- the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_124164828_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>10 <DD>They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west.<DT>11 <DD>They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes,&quot; declares the LORD. <DT>12 <DD>Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_124164828_1">[2] Some Septuagint manuscripts; Hebrew <I>they</I></A></LI>
