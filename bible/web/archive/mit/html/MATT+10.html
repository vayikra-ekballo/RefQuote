</DL><B>Matthew 10</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_1">1</a>]</sup>   spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.<DT>2 <DD>These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;<DT>3 <DD>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;<DT>4 <DD>Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.<DT>5 <DD>These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: &quot;Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.<DT>6 <DD>Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.<DT>7 <DD>As you go, preach this message: `The kingdom of heaven is near.'<DT>8 <DD>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_2">2</a>]</sup>   drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.<DT>9 <DD>Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts;<DT>10 <DD>take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or a staff; for the worker is worth his keep.<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave.<DT>12 <DD>As you enter the home, give it your greeting.<DT>13 <DD>If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.<DT>14 <DD>If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.<DT>15 <DD>I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.<DT>16 <DD>I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.<DT>17 <DD>&quot;Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.<DT>18 <DD>On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.<DT>19 <DD>But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,<DT>20 <DD>for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.<DT>22 <DD>All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.<DT>23 <DD>When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.<DT>24 <DD>&quot;A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.<DT>25 <DD>It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_3">3</a>]</sup>   how much more the members of his household!<DT>26 <DD>&quot;So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.<DT>27 <DD>What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.<DT>28 <DD>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<DT>29 <DD>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_4">4</a>]</sup>  ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.<DT>30 <DD>And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<DT>31 <DD>So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.<DT>32 <DD>&quot;Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.<DT>33 <DD>But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.<DT>34 <DD>&quot;Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.<DT>35 <DD>For I have come to turn &quot;`a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--<DT>36 <DD>a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' <sup>[<a href="#footnote_185346099_5">5</a>]</sup>  <DT>37 <DD>&quot;Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;<DT>38 <DD>and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.<DT>39 <DD>Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.<DT>40 <DD>&quot;He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.<DT>41 <DD>Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.<DT>42 <DD>And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_185346099_1">[1] Greek <I>unclean</I></A></LI>
