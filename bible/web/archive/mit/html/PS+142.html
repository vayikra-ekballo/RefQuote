</DL><B>Psalm 142</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 142  A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_572359874_1">1</a>]</sup>   of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.<DT>1 <DD>I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy.<DT>2 <DD>I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble. <DT>3 <DD>When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me.<DT>4 <DD>Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life. <DT>5 <DD>I cry to you, O LORD; I say, &quot;You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.&quot;<DT>6 <DD>Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.<DT>7 <DD>Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name.  Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_572359874_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
