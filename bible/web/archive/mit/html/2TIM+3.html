</DL><B>2 Timothy 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.<DT>2 <DD>People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,<DT>3 <DD>without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,<DT>4 <DD>treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God--<DT>5 <DD>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.<DT>6 <DD>They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,<DT>7 <DD>always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.<DT>8 <DD>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.<DT>9 <DD>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.<DT>10 <DD>You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,<DT>11 <DD>persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.<DT>12 <DD>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,<DT>13 <DD>while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.<DT>14 <DD>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,<DT>15 <DD>and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.<DT>16 <DD>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,<DT>17 <DD>so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</DL><OL></OL>
