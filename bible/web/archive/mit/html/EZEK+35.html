</DL><B>Ezekiel 35</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it<DT>3 <DD>and say: `This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste.<DT>4 <DD>I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.<DT>5 <DD>&quot;`Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax,<DT>6 <DD>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.<DT>7 <DD>I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go.<DT>8 <DD>I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.<DT>9 <DD>I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.<DT>10 <DD>&quot;`Because you have said, &quot;These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,&quot; even though I the LORD was there,<DT>11 <DD>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.<DT>12 <DD>Then you will know that I the LORD have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, &quot;They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.&quot;<DT>13 <DD>You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it.<DT>14 <DD>This is what the Sovereign LORD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.<DT>15 <DD>Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, O Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'&quot; </DL><OL></OL>
