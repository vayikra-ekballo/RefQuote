</DL><B>Exodus 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.&quot;<DT>2 <DD>God also said to Moses, &quot;I am the LORD.<DT>3 <DD>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_1">1</a>]</sup>   but by my name the LORD <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_2">2</a>]</sup>   I did not make myself known to them. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_3">3</a>]</sup>  <DT>4 <DD>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.<DT>5 <DD>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;Therefore, say to the Israelites: `I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.<DT>7 <DD>I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.<DT>8 <DD>And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'&quot;<DT>9 <DD>Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.<DT>10 <DD>Then the LORD said to Moses,<DT>11 <DD>&quot;Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.&quot;<DT>12 <DD>But Moses said to the LORD, &quot;If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_4">4</a>]</sup>  ?&quot;<DT>13 <DD>Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt. <DT>14 <DD>These were the heads of their families <sup>[<a href="#footnote_167332253_5">5</a>]</sup>  :  The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.<DT>15 <DD>The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.<DT>16 <DD>These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.<DT>17 <DD>The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.<DT>18 <DD>The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.<DT>19 <DD>The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.<DT>20 <DD>Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.<DT>21 <DD>The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zicri.<DT>22 <DD>The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.<DT>23 <DD>Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.<DT>24 <DD>The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.<DT>25 <DD>Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.  These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan. <DT>26 <DD>It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, &quot;Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.&quot;<DT>27 <DD>They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.<DT>28 <DD>Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,<DT>29 <DD>he said to him, &quot;I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.&quot;<DT>30 <DD>But Moses said to the LORD, &quot;Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?&quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_167332253_1">[3] Hebrew <I>El-Shaddai</I></A></LI>
