</DL><B>Psalm 40</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 40  For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.<DT>2 <DD>He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.<DT>3 <DD>He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD. <DT>4 <DD>Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>5 <DD>Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare. <DT>6 <DD>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_2">2</a>]</sup>   <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_3">3</a>]</sup>  ; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.<DT>7 <DD>Then I said, &quot;Here I am, I have come-- it is written about me in the scroll. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_452265626_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>8 <DD>I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.&quot; <DT>9 <DD>I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you know, O LORD.<DT>10 <DD>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly. <DT>11 <DD>Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.<DT>12 <DD>For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me. <DT>13 <DD>Be pleased, O LORD, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.<DT>14 <DD>May all who seek to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.<DT>15 <DD>May those who say to me, &quot;Aha! Aha!&quot; be appalled at their own shame.<DT>16 <DD>But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, &quot;The LORD be exalted!&quot; <DT>17 <DD>Yet I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_452265626_1">[4] Or <I>to falsehood</I></A></LI>
