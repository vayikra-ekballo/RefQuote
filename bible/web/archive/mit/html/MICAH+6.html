</DL><B>Micah 6</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Listen to what the LORD says: &quot;Stand up, plead your case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.<DT>2 <DD>Hear, O mountains, the LORD's accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.<DT>4 <DD>I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.<DT>5 <DD>My people, remember what Balak king of Moab counseled and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember [your journey] from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.&quot; <DT>6 <DD>With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?<DT>7 <DD>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?<DT>8 <DD>He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. <DT>9 <DD>Listen! The LORD is calling to the city-- and to fear your name is wisdom-- &quot;Heed the rod and the One who appointed it. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_1">1</a>]</sup>  <DT>10 <DD>Am I still to forget, O wicked house, your ill-gotten treasures and the short ephah, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_2">2</a>]</sup>   which is accursed?<DT>11 <DD>Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?<DT>12 <DD>Her rich men are violent; her people are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully.<DT>13 <DD>Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins.<DT>14 <DD>You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_3">3</a>]</sup>   You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword.<DT>15 <DD>You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil on yourselves, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.<DT>16 <DD>You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house, and you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_587762005_4">4</a>]</sup>  &quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_587762005_1">[9] The meaning of the Hebrew for this line is uncertain.</A></LI>
