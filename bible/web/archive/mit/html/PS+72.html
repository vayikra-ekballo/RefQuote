May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.<DT>16 <DD>Let grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field.<DT>17 <DD>May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun.  All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed. <DT>18 <DD>Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.<DT>19 <DD>Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen. <DT>20 <DD>This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_377480891_1">[2] Or <I>May he</I>; similarly in verses 3-11 and 17</A></LI>
