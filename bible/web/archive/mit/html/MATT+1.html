</DL><B>Matthew 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham: <DT>2 <DD>Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,<DT>3 <DD>Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,<DT>4 <DD>Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,<DT>5 <DD>Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,<DT>6 <DD>and Jesse the father of King David.  David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,<DT>7 <DD>Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,<DT>8 <DD>Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,<DT>9 <DD>Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,<DT>10 <DD>Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,<DT>11 <DD>and Josiah the father of Jeconiah <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_1">1</a>]</sup>   and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. <DT>12 <DD>After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,<DT>13 <DD>Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,<DT>14 <DD>Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,<DT>15 <DD>Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,<DT>16 <DD>and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. <DT>17 <DD>Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.<DT>19 <DD>Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.<DT>20 <DD>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &quot;Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.<DT>21 <DD>She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_3">3</a>]</sup>   because he will save his people from their sins.&quot;<DT>22 <DD>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:<DT>23 <DD>&quot;The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel&quot; <sup>[<a href="#footnote_305023583_4">4</a>]</sup>  --which means, &quot;God with us.&quot;<DT>24 <DD>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.<DT>25 <DD>But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_305023583_1">[11] That is, Jehoiachin; also in verse 12</A></LI>
