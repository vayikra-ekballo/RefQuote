</DL><B>Ecclesiastes 1</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The words of the Teacher, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_756827092_1">1</a>]</sup>   son of David, king in Jerusalem:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Meaningless! Meaningless!&quot; says the Teacher. &quot;Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.&quot; <DT>3 <DD>What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?<DT>4 <DD>Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.<DT>5 <DD>The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.<DT>6 <DD>The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.<DT>7 <DD>All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.<DT>8 <DD>All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.<DT>9 <DD>What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.<DT>10 <DD>Is there anything of which one can say, &quot;Look! This is something new&quot;? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.<DT>11 <DD>There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.<DT>12 <DD>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.<DT>13 <DD>I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!<DT>14 <DD>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.<DT>15 <DD>What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.<DT>16 <DD>I thought to myself, &quot;Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.&quot;<DT>17 <DD>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.<DT>18 <DD>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_756827092_1">[1] Or <I>leader of the assembly</I>; also in verses 2 and 12</A></LI>
