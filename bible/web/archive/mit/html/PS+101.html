</DL><B>Psalm 101</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 101  Of David. A psalm.<DT>1 <DD>I will sing of your love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will sing praise.<DT>2 <DD>I will be careful to lead a blameless life-- when will you come to me?  I will walk in my house with blameless heart.<DT>3 <DD>I will set before my eyes no vile thing.  The deeds of faithless men I hate; they will not cling to me.<DT>4 <DD>Men of perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with evil. <DT>5 <DD>Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, him will I not endure. <DT>6 <DD>My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he whose walk is blameless will minister to me. <DT>7 <DD>No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence. <DT>8 <DD>Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD. </DL><OL></OL>
