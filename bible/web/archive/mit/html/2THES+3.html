</DL><B>2 Thessalonians 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.<DT>2 <DD>And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.<DT>3 <DD>But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.<DT>4 <DD>We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.<DT>5 <DD>May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.<DT>6 <DD>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching <sup>[<a href="#footnote_270790527_1">1</a>]</sup>   you received from us.<DT>7 <DD>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,<DT>8 <DD>nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.<DT>9 <DD>We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.<DT>10 <DD>For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &quot;If a man will not work, he shall not eat.&quot;<DT>11 <DD>We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are busybodies.<DT>12 <DD>Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.<DT>13 <DD>And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.<DT>14 <DD>If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel ashamed.<DT>15 <DD>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. <DT>16 <DD>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.<DT>17 <DD>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.<DT>18 <DD>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_270790527_1">[6] Or <I>tradition</I></A></LI>
