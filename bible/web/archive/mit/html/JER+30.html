</DL><B>Jeremiah 30</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: `Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you.<DT>3 <DD>The days are coming,' declares the LORD, `when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity <sup>[<a href="#footnote_279119137_1">1</a>]</sup>   and restore them to the land I gave their forefathers to possess,' says the LORD.&quot;<DT>4 <DD>These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:<DT>5 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot;`Cries of fear are heard-- terror, not peace.<DT>6 <DD>Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale?<DT>7 <DD>How awful that day will be! None will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it. <DT>8 <DD>&quot;` In that day,' declares the LORD Almighty, `I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them.<DT>9 <DD>Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. <DT>10 <DD>&quot;`So do not fear, O Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, O Israel,'  declares the LORD. `I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.<DT>11 <DD>I am with you and will save you,' declares the LORD. `Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.'<DT>12 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot;`Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing.<DT>13 <DD>There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you.<DT>14 <DD>All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many.<DT>15 <DD>Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you. <DT>16 <DD>&quot;`But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil.<DT>17 <DD>But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,'  declares the LORD, `because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.'<DT>18 <DD>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot;`I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place.<DT>19 <DD>From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained.<DT>20 <DD>Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them.<DT>21 <DD>Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?'  declares the LORD.<DT>22 <DD>&quot;`So you will be my people, and I will be your God.'&quot; <DT>23 <DD>See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.<DT>24 <DD>The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_279119137_1">[3] Or <I>will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah</I></A></LI>
