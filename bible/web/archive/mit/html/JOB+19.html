</DL><B>Job 19</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Then Job replied:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;How long will you torment me and crush me with words?<DT>3 <DD>Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.<DT>4 <DD>If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.<DT>5 <DD>If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,<DT>6 <DD>then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me. <DT>7 <DD>&quot;Though I cry, `I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.<DT>8 <DD>He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.<DT>9 <DD>He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.<DT>10 <DD>He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.<DT>11 <DD>His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.<DT>12 <DD>His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. <DT>13 <DD>&quot;He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.<DT>14 <DD>My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.<DT>15 <DD>My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.<DT>16 <DD>I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.<DT>17 <DD>My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.<DT>18 <DD>Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.<DT>19 <DD>All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.<DT>20 <DD>I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>21 <DD>&quot;Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.<DT>22 <DD>Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh? <DT>23 <DD>&quot;Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,<DT>24 <DD>that they were inscribed with an iron tool on <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_2">2</a>]</sup>   lead, or engraved in rock forever!<DT>25 <DD>I know that my Redeemer <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_3">3</a>]</sup>   lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_4">4</a>]</sup>  <DT>26 <DD>And after my skin has been destroyed, yet <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_5">5</a>]</sup>   in <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_6">6</a>]</sup>   my flesh I will see God;<DT>27 <DD>I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me! <DT>28 <DD>&quot;If you say, `How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_7">7</a>]</sup>  '<DT>29 <DD>you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_115870484_8">8</a>]</sup>  &quot;</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_115870484_1">[20] Or <I>only my gums</I></A></LI>
