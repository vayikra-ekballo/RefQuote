</DL><B>Psalm 89</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 89  A maskil <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_1">1</a>]</sup>   of Ethan the Ezrahite.<DT>1 <DD>I will sing of the LORD's great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.<DT>2 <DD>I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself. <DT>3 <DD>You said, &quot;I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,<DT>4 <DD>`I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.'&quot; Selah <DT>5 <DD>The heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.<DT>6 <DD>For who in the skies above can compare with the LORD? Who is like the LORD among the heavenly beings?<DT>7 <DD>In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.<DT>8 <DD>O LORD God Almighty, who is like you? You are mighty, O LORD, and your faithfulness surrounds you. <DT>9 <DD>You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.<DT>10 <DD>You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.<DT>11 <DD>The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it.<DT>12 <DD>You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.<DT>13 <DD>Your arm is endued with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted. <DT>14 <DD>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.<DT>15 <DD>Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, O LORD.<DT>16 <DD>They rejoice in your name all day long; they exult in your righteousness.<DT>17 <DD>For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn. <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_2">2</a>]</sup>  <DT>18 <DD>Indeed, our shield <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_3">3</a>]</sup>   belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel. <DT>19 <DD>Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: &quot;I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have exalted a young man from among the people.<DT>20 <DD>I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him.<DT>21 <DD>My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.<DT>22 <DD>No enemy will subject him to tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.<DT>23 <DD>I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries.<DT>24 <DD>My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_4">4</a>]</sup>   will be exalted.<DT>25 <DD>I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.<DT>26 <DD>He will call out to me, `You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.'<DT>27 <DD>I will also appoint him my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.<DT>28 <DD>I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.<DT>29 <DD>I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure. <DT>30 <DD>&quot;If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,<DT>31 <DD>if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,<DT>32 <DD>I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging;<DT>33 <DD>but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.<DT>34 <DD>I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.<DT>35 <DD>Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness-- and I will not lie to David--<DT>36 <DD>that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun;<DT>37 <DD>it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.&quot; Selah <DT>38 <DD>But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one.<DT>39 <DD>You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.<DT>40 <DD>You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.<DT>41 <DD>All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.<DT>42 <DD>You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.<DT>43 <DD>You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.<DT>44 <DD>You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.<DT>45 <DD>You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame. Selah <DT>46 <DD>How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?<DT>47 <DD>Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all men!<DT>48 <DD>What man can live and not see death, or save himself from the power of the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_5">5</a>]</sup>  ? Selah<DT>49 <DD>O Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?<DT>50 <DD>Remember, Lord, how your servant has <sup>[<a href="#footnote_165763188_6">6</a>]</sup>   been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,<DT>51 <DD>the taunts with which your enemies have mocked, O LORD, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one. <DT>52 <DD>Praise be to the LORD forever! Amen and Amen. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_165763188_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
