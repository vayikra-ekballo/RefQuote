</DL><B>Isaiah 3</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: all supplies of food and all supplies of water,<DT>2 <DD>the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,<DT>3 <DD>the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter. <DT>4 <DD>I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.<DT>5 <DD>People will oppress each other-- man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable. <DT>6 <DD>A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, &quot;You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!&quot;<DT>7 <DD>But in that day he will cry out, &quot;I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people.&quot; <DT>8 <DD>Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.<DT>9 <DD>The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. <DT>10 <DD>Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.<DT>11 <DD>Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done. <DT>12 <DD>Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path. <DT>13 <DD>The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.<DT>14 <DD>The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: &quot;It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.<DT>15 <DD>What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?&quot;  declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <DT>16 <DD>The LORD says, &quot;The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.<DT>17 <DD>Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald.&quot;<DT>18 <DD>In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,<DT>19 <DD>the earrings and bracelets and veils,<DT>20 <DD>the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,<DT>21 <DD>the signet rings and nose rings,<DT>22 <DD>the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses<DT>23 <DD>and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.<DT>24 <DD>Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.<DT>25 <DD>Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.<DT>26 <DD>The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.</DL><OL></OL>
