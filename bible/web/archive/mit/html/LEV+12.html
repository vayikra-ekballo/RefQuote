</DL><B>Leviticus 12</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The LORD said to Moses,<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Say to the Israelites: `A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period.<DT>3 <DD>On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.<DT>4 <DD>Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.<DT>5 <DD>If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding.<DT>6 <DD>&quot;`When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.<DT>7 <DD>He shall offer them before the LORD to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood. &quot;`These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.<DT>8 <DD>If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
