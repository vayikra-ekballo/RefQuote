</DL><B>1 Corinthians 11</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.<DT>2 <DD>I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_1">1</a>]</sup>   just as I passed them on to you.<DT>3 <DD>Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.<DT>4 <DD>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.<DT>5 <DD>And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved.<DT>6 <DD>If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.<DT>7 <DD>A man ought not to cover his head, <sup>[<a href="#footnote_854534052_2">2</a>]</sup>   since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.<DT>8 <DD>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;<DT>9 <DD>neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.<DT>10 <DD>For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.<DT>11 <DD>In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.<DT>12 <DD>For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.<DT>13 <DD>Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?<DT>14 <DD>Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,<DT>15 <DD>but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.<DT>16 <DD>If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God.<DT>17 <DD>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.<DT>18 <DD>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.<DT>19 <DD>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.<DT>20 <DD>When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,<DT>21 <DD>for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.<DT>22 <DD>Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!<DT>23 <DD>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,<DT>24 <DD>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, &quot;This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.&quot;<DT>25 <DD>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.&quot;<DT>26 <DD>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.<DT>27 <DD>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.<DT>28 <DD>A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.<DT>29 <DD>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.<DT>30 <DD>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.<DT>31 <DD>But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.<DT>32 <DD>When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.<DT>33 <DD>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.<DT>34 <DD>If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.</DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_854534052_1">[2] Or <I>traditions</I></A></LI>
