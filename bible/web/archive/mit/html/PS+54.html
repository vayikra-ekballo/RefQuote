When the Ziphites had gone to Saul and said, &quot;Is not David hiding among us?&quot;<DT>1 <DD>Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.<DT>2 <DD>Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth. <DT>3 <DD>Strangers are attacking me; ruthless men seek my life-- men without regard for God. Selah <DT>4 <DD>Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me. <DT>5 <DD>Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them. <DT>6 <DD>I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, O LORD, for it is good.<DT>7 <DD>For he has delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_487482367_1">[Title: Probably a literary or musical term</A></LI>
