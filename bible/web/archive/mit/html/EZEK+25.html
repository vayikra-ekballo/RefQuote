</DL><B>Ezekiel 25</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The word of the LORD came to me:<DT>2 <DD>&quot;Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.<DT>3 <DD>Say to them, `Hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you said &quot;Aha!&quot; over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile,<DT>4 <DD>therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.<DT>5 <DD>I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD.<DT>6 <DD>For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel,<DT>7 <DD>therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.'&quot;<DT>8 <DD>&quot;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: `Because Moab and Seir said, &quot;Look, the house of Judah has become like all the other nations,&quot;<DT>9 <DD>therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns--Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim--the glory of that land.<DT>10 <DD>I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations;<DT>11 <DD>and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'&quot;<DT>12 <DD>&quot;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: `Because Edom took revenge on the house of Judah and became very guilty by doing so,<DT>13 <DD>therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill its men and their animals. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.<DT>14 <DD>I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign LORD.'&quot;<DT>15 <DD>&quot;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: `Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah,<DT>16 <DD>therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast.<DT>17 <DD>I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I take vengeance on them.'&quot;</DL><OL></OL>
