</DL><B>Psalm 63</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 63  A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah.<DT>1 <DD>O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water. <DT>2 <DD>I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.<DT>3 <DD>Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.<DT>4 <DD>I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.<DT>5 <DD>My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you. <DT>6 <DD>On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.<DT>7 <DD>Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.<DT>8 <DD>My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me. <DT>9 <DD>They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.<DT>10 <DD>They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals. <DT>11 <DD>But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God's name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced. </DL><OL></OL>
