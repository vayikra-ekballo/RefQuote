</DL><B>Psalm 37</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>Psalm 37  Of David.  <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_1">1</a>]</sup>   <DT>1 <DD>Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong;<DT>2 <DD>for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. <DT>3 <DD>Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.<DT>4 <DD>Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. <DT>5 <DD>Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this:<DT>6 <DD>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. <DT>7 <DD>Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. <DT>8 <DD>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.<DT>9 <DD>For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. <DT>10 <DD>A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.<DT>11 <DD>But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. <DT>12 <DD>The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;<DT>13 <DD>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. <DT>14 <DD>The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.<DT>15 <DD>But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. <DT>16 <DD>Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;<DT>17 <DD>for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. <DT>18 <DD>The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.<DT>19 <DD>In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty. <DT>20 <DD>But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke. <DT>21 <DD>The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;<DT>22 <DD>those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off. <DT>23 <DD>If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;<DT>24 <DD>though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand. <DT>25 <DD>I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.<DT>26 <DD>They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed. <DT>27 <DD>Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.<DT>28 <DD>For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones.  They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;<DT>29 <DD>the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. <DT>30 <DD>The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.<DT>31 <DD>The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip. <DT>32 <DD>The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;<DT>33 <DD>but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial. <DT>34 <DD>Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it. <DT>35 <DD>I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,<DT>36 <DD>but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found. <DT>37 <DD>Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_2">2</a>]</sup>   for the man of peace.<DT>38 <DD>But all sinners will be destroyed; the future <sup>[<a href="#footnote_136212670_3">3</a>]</sup>   of the wicked will be cut off. <DT>39 <DD>The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.<DT>40 <DD>The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him. </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_136212670_1">This psalm is an acrostic poem, the stanzas of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</A></LI>
