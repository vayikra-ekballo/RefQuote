</DL><B>Isaiah 57</B><DL COMPACT><DT>1 <DD>The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.<DT>2 <DD>Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death. <DT>3 <DD>&quot;But you--come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!<DT>4 <DD>Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?<DT>5 <DD>You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.<DT>6 <DD>[The idols] among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; they, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things, should I relent?<DT>7 <DD>You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.<DT>8 <DD>Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.<DT>9 <DD>You went to Molech <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_1">1</a>]</sup>   with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_2">2</a>]</sup>   far away; you descended to the grave <sup>[<a href="#footnote_186414844_3">3</a>]</sup>   itself!<DT>10 <DD>You were wearied by all your ways, but you would not say, `It is hopeless.' You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint. <DT>11 <DD>&quot;Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me, and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?<DT>12 <DD>I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.<DT>13 <DD>When you cry out for help, let your collection [of idols] save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.&quot;<DT>14 <DD>And it will be said: &quot;Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.&quot;<DT>15 <DD>For this is what the high and lofty One says-- he who lives forever, whose name is holy: &quot;I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.<DT>16 <DD>I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me-- the breath of man that I have created.<DT>17 <DD>I was enraged by his sinful greed; I punished him, and hid my face in anger, yet he kept on in his willful ways.<DT>18 <DD>I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him,<DT>19 <DD>creating praise on the lips of the mourners in Israel. Peace, peace, to those far and near,&quot; says the LORD. &quot;And I will heal them.&quot;<DT>20 <DD>But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.<DT>21 <DD>&quot;There is no peace,&quot; says my God, &quot;for the wicked.&quot; </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_186414844_1">[9] Or <I>to the king</I></A></LI>
