Of David.<DT>1 <DD>The fool <sup>[<a href="#footnote_191951465_1">1</a>]</sup>   says in his heart, &quot;There is no God.&quot; They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good. <DT>2 <DD>The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.<DT>3 <DD>All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one. <DT>4 <DD>Will evildoers never learn-- those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the LORD?<DT>5 <DD>There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.<DT>6 <DD>You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the LORD is their refuge. <DT>7 <DD>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! </DL><OL><LI><A NAME="footnote_191951465_1">[1] The Hebrew words rendered <I>fool</I> in Psalms denote one who is morally deficient.</A></LI>
