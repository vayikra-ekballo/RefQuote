He prayed three times a day, just as he had always done, giving thanks to his God.</span> <span class=\"text Dan-6-11\" id=\"en-NLT-21893\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11\u00a0</sup>Then the officials went together to Daniel\u2019s house and found him praying and asking for God\u2019s help.</span> <span class=\"text Dan-6-12\" id=\"en-NLT-21894\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12\u00a0</sup>So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. \u201cDid you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human\u2014except to you, Your Majesty\u2014will be thrown into the den of lions?\u201d</span></p><p><span class=\"text Dan-6-12\">\u201cYes,\u201d the king replied, \u201cthat decision stands; it is an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Dan-6-13\" id=\"en-NLT-21895\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13\u00a0</sup>Then they told the king, \u201cThat man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is ignoring you and your law. He still prays to his God three times a day.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Dan-6-14\" id=\"en-NLT-21896\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14\u00a0</sup>Hearing this, the king was deeply troubled, and he tried to think of a way to save Daniel.
