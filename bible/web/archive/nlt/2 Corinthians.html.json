But I do know</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-4\" id=\"en-NLT-28987\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4\u00a0</sup>that I was caught up<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-28987b\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-28987b\" title=\"See footnote b\"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-28987b\" title=\"See footnote b\">b</a>]</sup> to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-5\" id=\"en-NLT-28988\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5\u00a0</sup>That experience is worth boasting about, but I\u2019m not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-6\" id=\"en-NLT-28989\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6\u00a0</sup>If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won\u2019t do it, because I don\u2019t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message,</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-7\" id=\"en-NLT-28990\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7\u00a0</sup>even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-8\" id=\"en-NLT-28991\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8\u00a0</sup>Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-9\" id=\"en-NLT-28992\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9\u00a0</sup>Each time he said, <span class=\"woj\">\u201cMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.\u201d</span> So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-10\" id=\"en-NLT-28993\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10\u00a0</sup>That\u2019s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-11\" id=\"en-NLT-28994\">Paul\u2019s Concern for the Corinthians</span></h3><p class=\"first-line-none\"><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-11\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11\u00a0</sup>You have made me act like a fool. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these \u201csuper apostles,\u201d even though I am nothing at all.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-12\" id=\"en-NLT-28995\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12\u00a0</sup>When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-13\" id=\"en-NLT-28996\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13\u00a0</sup>The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong!</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-14\" id=\"en-NLT-28997\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14\u00a0</sup>Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don\u2019t want what you have\u2014I want you. After all, children don\u2019t provide for their parents. Rather, parents provide for their children.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-15\" id=\"en-NLT-28998\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15\u00a0</sup>I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-16\" id=\"en-NLT-28999\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16\u00a0</sup>Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-17\" id=\"en-NLT-29000\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17\u00a0</sup>But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you?</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-18\" id=\"en-NLT-29001\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18\u00a0</sup>When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other\u2019s steps, doing things the same way.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-12-19\" id=\"en-NLT-29002\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19\u00a0</sup>Perhaps you think we\u2019re saying these things just to defend ourselves. No, we tell you this as Christ\u2019s servants, and with God as our witness. Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-20\" id=\"en-NLT-29003\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20\u00a0</sup>For I am afraid that when I come I won\u2019t like what I find, and you won\u2019t like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-12-21\" id=\"en-NLT-29004\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21\u00a0</sup>Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence. And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins. You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure.</span></p>  \n</div>",
