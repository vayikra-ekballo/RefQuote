So a man from Bethlehem in Judah left his home and went to live in the country of Moab, taking his wife and two sons with him.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-1-2\" id=\"en-NLT-7106\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2\u00a0</sup>The man\u2019s name was Elimelech, and his wife was Naomi. Their two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. And when they reached Moab, they settled there.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-1-3\" id=\"en-NLT-7107\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3\u00a0</sup>Then Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-1-4\" id=\"en-NLT-7108\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4\u00a0</sup>The two sons married Moabite women. One married a woman named Orpah, and the other a woman named Ruth. But about ten years later,</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-1-5\" id=\"en-NLT-7109\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5\u00a0</sup>both Mahlon and Kilion died.

So Naomi and her daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab to return to her homeland.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-1-7\" id=\"en-NLT-7111\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7\u00a0</sup>With her two daughters-in-law she set out from the place where she had been living, and they took the road that would lead them back to Judah.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-1-8\" id=\"en-NLT-7112\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8\u00a0</sup>But on the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \u201cGo back to your mothers\u2019 homes.

She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-4\" id=\"en-NLT-7171\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4\u00a0</sup>I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don\u2019t want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you.\u201d</span></p><p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-4\">The man replied, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll redeem it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-5\" id=\"en-NLT-7172\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5\u00a0</sup>Then Boaz told him, \u201cOf course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband\u2019s name and keep the land in the family.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-6\" id=\"en-NLT-7173\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6\u00a0</sup>\u201cThen I can\u2019t redeem it,\u201d the family redeemer replied, \u201cbecause this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-7\" id=\"en-NLT-7174\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7\u00a0</sup>Now in those days it was the custom in Israel for anyone transferring a right of purchase to remove his sandal and hand it to the other party. This publicly validated the transaction.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-8\" id=\"en-NLT-7175\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8\u00a0</sup>So the other family redeemer drew off his sandal as he said to Boaz, \u201cYou buy the land.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-9\" id=\"en-NLT-7176\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9\u00a0</sup>Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, \u201cYou are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-10\" id=\"en-NLT-7177\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10\u00a0</sup>And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today.\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-11\" id=\"en-NLT-7178\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11\u00a0</sup>Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, \u201cWe are witnesses! May the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> make this woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, from whom all the nation of Israel descended! May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-12\" id=\"en-NLT-7179\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12\u00a0</sup>And may the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> give you descendants by this young woman who will be like those of our ancestor Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah.\u201d</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Ruth-4-13\" id=\"en-NLT-7180\">The Descendants of Boaz</span></h3><p class=\"first-line-none\"><span class=\"text Ruth-4-13\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13\u00a0</sup>So Boaz took Ruth into his home, and she became his wife. When he slept with her, the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> enabled her to become pregnant, and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-14\" id=\"en-NLT-7181\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14\u00a0</sup>Then the women of the town said to Naomi, \u201cPraise the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, who has now provided a redeemer for your family! May this child be famous in Israel.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-15\" id=\"en-NLT-7182\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15\u00a0</sup>May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!\u201d</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-16\" id=\"en-NLT-7183\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16\u00a0</sup>Naomi took the baby and cuddled him to her breast. And she cared for him as if he were her own.</span> <span class=\"text Ruth-4-17\" id=\"en-NLT-7184\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17\u00a0</sup>The neighbor women said, \u201cNow at last Naomi has a son again!\u201d And they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ruth-4-18\" id=\"en-NLT-7185\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18\u00a0</sup>This is the genealogical record of their ancestor Perez:</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Ruth-4-18\">Perez was the father of Hezron.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-19\" id=\"en-NLT-7186\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19\u00a0</sup>Hezron was the father of Ram.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-19\">Ram was the father of Amminadab.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-20\" id=\"en-NLT-7187\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20\u00a0</sup>Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-20\">Nahshon was the father of Salmon.<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-7187a\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-7187a\" title=\"See footnote a\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-7187a\" title=\"See footnote a\">a</a>]</sup></span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-21\" id=\"en-NLT-7188\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21\u00a0</sup>Salmon was the father of Boaz.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-21\">Boaz was the father of Obed.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-22\" id=\"en-NLT-7189\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22\u00a0</sup>Obed was the father of Jesse.</span><br/><span class=\"text Ruth-4-22\">Jesse was the father of David.</span></p></div>  \n</div>",
