But now I find that I must write about something else, urging you to defend the faith that God has entrusted once for all time to his holy people.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-4\" id=\"en-NLT-30638\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4\u00a0</sup>I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches, saying that God\u2019s marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, for they have denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-5\" id=\"en-NLT-30639\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5\u00a0</sup>So I want to remind you, though you already know these things, that Jesus<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30639b\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30639b\" title=\"See footnote b\"&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30639b\" title=\"See footnote b\">b</a>]</sup> first rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt, but later he destroyed those who did not remain faithful.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-6\" id=\"en-NLT-30640\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6\u00a0</sup>And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgment.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-7\" id=\"en-NLT-30641\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7\u00a0</sup>And don\u2019t forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God\u2019s judgment.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-8\" id=\"en-NLT-30642\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8\u00a0</sup>In the same way, these people\u2014who claim authority from their dreams\u2014live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30642c\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30642c\" title=\"See footnote c\"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30642c\" title=\"See footnote c\">c</a>]</sup></span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-9\" id=\"en-NLT-30643\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9\u00a0</sup>But even Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels,<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30643d\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30643d\" title=\"See footnote d\"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30643d\" title=\"See footnote d\">d</a>]</sup> did not dare accuse the devil of blasphemy, but simply said, \u201cThe Lord rebuke you!\u201d (This took place when Michael was arguing with the devil about Moses\u2019 body.)</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-10\" id=\"en-NLT-30644\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10\u00a0</sup>But these people scoff at things they do not understand. Like unthinking animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and so they bring about their own destruction.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-11\" id=\"en-NLT-30645\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11\u00a0</sup>What sorrow awaits them! For they follow in the footsteps of Cain, who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they deceive people for money. And like Korah, they perish in their rebellion.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-12\" id=\"en-NLT-30646\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12\u00a0</sup>When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord\u2019s love, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you.<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30646e\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30646e\" title=\"See footnote e\"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30646e\" title=\"See footnote e\">e</a>]</sup> They are like shameless shepherds who care only for themselves. They are like clouds blowing over the land without giving any rain. They are like trees in autumn that are doubly dead, for they bear no fruit and have been pulled up by the roots.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-13\" id=\"en-NLT-30647\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13\u00a0</sup>They are like wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their shameful deeds. They are like wandering stars, doomed forever to blackest darkness.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-14\" id=\"en-NLT-30648\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14\u00a0</sup>Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, \u201cListen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-15\" id=\"en-NLT-30649\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15\u00a0</sup>to execute judgment on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30649f\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30649f\" title=\"See footnote f\"&gt;f&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30649f\" title=\"See footnote f\">f</a>]</sup></span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-16\" id=\"en-NLT-30650\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16\u00a0</sup>These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Jude-1-17\" id=\"en-NLT-30651\">A Call to Remain Faithful</span></h3><p class=\"first-line-none\"><span class=\"text Jude-1-17\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17\u00a0</sup>But you, my dear friends, must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ predicted.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-18\" id=\"en-NLT-30652\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18\u00a0</sup>They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to satisfy their ungodly desires.</span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-19\" id=\"en-NLT-30653\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19\u00a0</sup>These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God\u2019s Spirit in them.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jude-1-20\" id=\"en-NLT-30654\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20\u00a0</sup>But you, dear friends, must build each other up in your most holy faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit,<sup class=\"footnote\" data-fn=\"#fen-NLT-30654g\" data-link='[&lt;a href=\"#fen-NLT-30654g\" title=\"See footnote g\"&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;]'>[<a href=\"#fen-NLT-30654g\" title=\"See footnote g\">g</a>]</sup></span> <span class=\"text Jude-1-21\" id=\"en-NLT-30655\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21\u00a0</sup>and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bring you eternal life.
